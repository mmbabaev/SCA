	<td class="line x" title="21:516	Our eventual goal is to recover a semantically and pragmatically appropriate syntactic analysis capable of supporting semantic interpretation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:516	Two stringent requirements follow immediately: firstly, the analyses assigned must determinately represent the syntactic relations that hold between all constituents in the input; secondly, they must be drawn from an a priori defined, well-formed set of possible syntactic analyses (such as the set defined by a generative grammar)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:516	Otherwise, semantic interpretation of the resultant analyses cannot be guaranteed to be (structurally) unambiguous, and the semantic operations defined (over syntactic configurations) cannot be guaranteed to match and yield an interpretation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:516	These requirements immediately suggest that approaches that recover only lexical tags (e.g. de Rose 1988) or a syntactic analysis that is the 'closest fit' to some previously defined set of possible analyses (e.g. Sampson, Haigh, and Atwell 1989), are inadequate (taken alone)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="26:516	However, the development of wide-coverage declarative and computationally tractable grammars makes this assumption questionable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:516	For example, the ANLT word and sentence grammar (Grover et al. 1989; Carroll and Grover 1989) consists of an English lexicon of approximately 40,000 lexemes and a 'compiled' fixed-arity term unification grammar containing around 700 phrase structure rules." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:516	Taylor, Grover, and Briscoe (1989) demonstrate that an earlier version of this grammar was capable of assigning the correct analysis to 96.8% of a corpus of 10,000 noun phrases extracted (without regard for their internal form) from a variety of corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:516	However, although Taylor, Grover, and Briscoe show that the ANLT grammar has very wide coverage, they abstract away from issues of lexical idiosyncrasy by formimg equivalence classes of noun phrases and parsing a single token of each class, and they do not address the issues of 1) tuning a grammar to a particular corpus or sublanguage 2) selecting the correct analysis from the set licensed by the grammar and 3) providing reliable analyses of input outside the coverage of the grammar." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:516	Firstly, it is clear that vocabulary, idiom, and conventionalized constructions used in, say, legal language and dictionary definitions, will differ both in terms of the range and frequency of words and constructions deployed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:516	Secondly, Church and Patil (1982) demonstrate that for a realistic grammar parsing realistic input, the set of possible analyses licensed by the grammar can be in the thousands." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:516	Finally, it is extremely unlikely that any generative grammar will ever be capable of correctly analyzing all naturally occurring input, even when tuned for a particular corpus or sublanguage (if only because of the synchronic idealization implicit in the assumption that the set of grammatical sentences of a language is well formed)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="39:516	This corpus was chosen because the vocabulary employed is restricted (to approximately 2,000 morphemes), average definition length is about 10 words (with a maximum of around 30), and each definition is independent, allowing us to ignore phenomena such as ellipsis." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="455:516	However, lexical idiosyncrasies are far less likely to be exhausted during the training phase, suggesting that it will be necessary to develop an automatic method of dealing with them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="456:516	In addition, the current system does not take account of differing frequencies of occurrence of lexical entries; for example, in the LOB corpus the verb believe occurs with a finite sentential complement in 90% of citations, although it is grammatical with at least five further patterns of complementation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="457:516	This type of lexical information, which will very likely vary between sublanguages, should be integrated into the probabilistic model." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="464:516	However, it is also clear that this approach will not succeed in all cases; for example, in the experiment the system appears to have developed a preference for local attachment of prepositional phrases (PPs), which is inappropriate in a 53 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 significant number of cases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="465:516	It is not surprising that probabilities based solely on the frequency of syntactic rules are not capable of resolving this type of ambiguity; in an example such as John saw the man on Monday again it is the temporal interpretation of Monday that favors the adverbial interpretation (and thus nonlocal attachment)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="100:191	It follows that ifBaumWelch re-estimation is to be an effective technique, the initial data must have either biasing in the transitions (the TO cases) or in the lexical probabilities (cases D0+T1 and DI+T1), but it is not necessary to have both (D2/D3+T0 and D0/DI+T1)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="141:191	The step forward taken in the work here is to show that there are three patterns of reestimation behaviour, with differing guidelines for how to use BW effectively, and that to obtain a good starting point when a hand-tagged corpus is 57 not available or is too small, either the lexicon or the transitions must be biased." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="142:191	While these may be useful heuristics from a practical point of view, the next step forward is to look for an automatic way of predicting the accuracy of the tagging process given a corpus and a model." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="145:191	However, preliminary experiments using such measures as the Kullback-Liebler distance between the initial and new models have again showed that it does not give good predictions of accuracy." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:188	The search for such factors only requires counting various sets of events that actually occur in a training corpus, and the method is thus able to survey a larger space of possible contextual factors than could be practically captured by a statistical model that required explicit probability estimates for every possible combination of factors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:188	Brill's results on part-of-speech tagging show that the method can outperform the HMM techniques widely used for that task, while also providing more compact and perspicuo.s models." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="13:188	Brill's Approach This learning approach starts with a supervised training corpus and a baseline heuristic for assigning initial values." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:188	In the part-of-speech tagging application, for example, the baseline heuristic might be to assign each known but ambiguous word whatever tag is most often correct for it in the training corpus, and to assign all unknown words an initial tag as nouns." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:188	Again, for tagging, the rule templates typically involve either the actual words or the tags currently assigned to words within a few positions on each side of the value to be changed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:188	The rule templates used in these experiments involve up to two of the currentlyassigned tags on each side of the tag being changed; they include \[ -C A/B \] (change tag A to tag B if the previous tag is C) and \[ --A/B C D \] (change A to B if the following two tags are C and D)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:188	During training, instantiated rules like \[ -DET V/N --\] are built by matching these templates against the training corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="71:184	5.1 Errors among Content Words It is clear that content words (here: nouns, verbs, adjectives, participles, proper nouns) are seldom involved in errors." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="73:184	If words from these categories are ever mixed up, they are mixed up in very specific patterns, namely with themselves (as when different inflected forms of the same stem coincide) or they are mixed up with words they are related to (e.g. , by derivation)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:184	Among the ten most common error types for either automatic or manual disambiguation, there are actually only two that involve content words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:184	One of these error types is almost exclusively in the realm of automatic disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:184	Swedish nouns are inflected according to five different declensions, one of which has zero plural." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:184	The automatic tagger sometimes mistakes singular nouns of that declension without modifiers for plurals, but never the other way round." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:184	This is just as could be expected; 'naked' plurals are far more common than 'naked' singulars in all declinations and will thus be favoured by the statistics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:184	To remedy this situation, it would probably be necessary to have a phrasal lexicon, as most instances of naked singular nouns appear in lexicalized phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:184	As has been pointed out for English material (cf.below) different inflections of the same verb can get mixed up." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:184	This phenomenon can be found in Swedish too, but not very frequently." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:184	The other common error type involving content words concerns adverbs derived from adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:184	The most frequent derivational pattern for Swedish adverbs makes them identical to neutral singular indefinite adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:184	Here both manual and automatic disambiguation leads to errors but in different directions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:184	The automatic tagger suggests adverb where there should have been an adjective, while human annotators sometimes call an adverb an adjective." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:184	Both types mainly occur post-verbally and often at the very end of a graphic sentence, where it may be difficult to decide whether the concerned word is a predicative adjective or an adverb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:184	It may well be that a subcategorization of verbs might eliminate the problem, but this is a large task to implement both in the lexicon and in the tagger." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:184	However, these errors are neither the most frequent nor the most disturbing ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:184	Instead, it is the function words that get mixed up in all their different uses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:184	Actually, almost all errors concern function words and a scrutiny of them makes it clear how doubtful the whole concept of correctness is in this connection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:184	5.2 Errors among Function Words The degree of homography or is it polysemy?" ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="94:184	Furthermore, the number of readings connected with each word token is highly dependent on the linguistic description used as a basis for the tagging system, its theoretical assumptions and the granularity of the system, among other things." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:184	The ten words most frequently involved in errors in the studied material are (with approximate translations and number of errors in parenthesis) the following: 'det' (it~the in neuter gender, 330 errors), 'ett' (a/one in neuter, 254), 'sore' (rel.pron and adv., 180), 'den' (it~the in common gender, 153), 'om' (if, about, 122), 'en' (a/one in common, 109), 'att' (that, inf.marker, 83), 'sS'." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="99:184	One interesting fact that the classification into error types makes clear is that all the different readings of these words do not get mixed tip at random but in rather strong, often mirror-like patterns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:184	Let us take the word 'om' as an example." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:184	It can be used as adverb, preposition, or subordinating conjunction and all the six possible mistagged combinations do occur, but with quite varying frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:184	Three of them are almost neglectable and one has a strong unidirectional pattern where the reading as an adverb (more precisely a verbal particle) is often taken for a preposition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:184	This is an instance of the by far most common error type in the entire material, and is of course directly dependent on the way verbal particles are treated in the underlying linguistic description." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:184	The remaining two error types are the most interesting ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:184	They form a bidirectional pattern where the reading as a preposition is confused with the reading as a subordinating conjunction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:184	Preposition instead of subjunction appears 40 times, subjunction instead of preposition 33 times, altogether 77 of the 122 errors connected with the word 'om'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:184	All errors on this word were machine-induced, except 8 cases where human annotators took a subjunction to 678 be a preposition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:184	Some of the error situations may be regarded as truly undecidable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:184	6 Tagging Undecidable Situations How are bidirectional error patterns like the one above to be treated?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:184	Looking at their close context, it is often impossible to handle the situation with some smart tagging restriction or other device." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:184	They are also so equal in number and so frequent that one cannot simply decide to let one reading overrule the other and live with the errors that such a happy-golucky solution would give rise to." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:184	(As a practicing corpus tagger, 1 know that this unorthodox method can sometimes be the best way out of problematic situations)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:184	Another possibility would be to amalgamate tile two readings into one, bivalued or underspecified, depending on how one chooses to see it." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="58:98	4 3.4 Unknown Words and Collocations The occurrence of 'unknown words', i. e., words not occurring in the training corpus, is a notorious problem in (probabilistic) part-of-speech tagging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:98	In our case, this problem is even more serious, since we know beforehand that some words will be treated as unknown although they do in fact occur in the training corpus (because of deviations Dom standard orthography)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:98	In the experiments reported below, we have allowed unknown words to belong to any part-of-speech (which is possible in the given context), but with different weightings for different parts-of-speech." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:98	More precisely, when a word cannot be found in the lexicon, we replace the product in (2) (cf.equation 1 above) with the product in (3), where TTR(ti) is the typetoken ratio of ti (in the training corpus)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:98	(2) p(t I I td (3) P(t I t_l)P(ti)TTR(t) In this way, we favor parts-of-speech with high probability and high type-token ratio." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:98	In practice, this favors open classes (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives) over closed classes (determiners, conjunctions, etc.), and more frequent ones (e. g., nouns) over less frequent ones (e. g., adjectives)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:98	In addition to 'unknown words', we have to deal with 'unknown collocations', i. e., biclasses that do not occur in the training data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:98	If these biclasses are simply assigned zero probability, then in tile extreme case a word which is in the lexicon may fail to get a tag because the contextual probabilities of all its known parts-of-speech are zero in the given context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:98	In order to prevent this, we use the following formula to assign contextual probabilities to unknown collocations: (4) P(ti l t_l) = P(ti)K The constant K is chosen in such a way that tile contextual probabilities defined by equation (4) are significantly lower than the 'real' contextual probabilities derived from the training corpus, so 4A common example is the ending -igt, which appears in many adjectives (neuter singular) and adverbs and which is usually reduced to -it in ordinary speech." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:98	that they only come into play when no known collocation is possible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:98	3.5 Pauses and Inaudible Speech As indicated earlier, the utterances to be tagged included markers for pauses and inaudible speech, since these were thought to contain information relevant for tile tagging process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:98	The symbol for inaudible (and therethre untranscribed) speech () -was simply added to the lexicon and assigned the 't)art-of-speech' major delimiter (mad), which is the category assigned to full stops, etc. in written texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:98	The result is that the tagger will not treat the last, word before tile untranscribed passage as immediate context for tile first word after tile passage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:98	For pintoes we have experimented with two different treatments, which are compared below." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:98	We refer to these different treatments as tagging condition 1 and 2, respectively:  Condition 1: Pauses are simply ignored in tile tagging process, which means that the last word before a pause is treated as immediate context for the first word after the pause." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:98	 Condition 2: Pause symbols are added to the lexicon, where short pauses are categorized as minor delimiters (mid) (commas, etc.), while long pauses are categorized as mad (fllll stops, etc.), which means that the contextual probabilities of words occurring before and after pauses in spoken language will be modelled on the probabilities of words occurring before and after certain punctuation marks in written language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:98	It was hypothesized that, in certain cases, the tagger might perform better under condition 2, since pauses in spoken language often though by no means always indicate major phrase boundaries or even breaks in the grammatical structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:98	3.6 Test Corpus The test corpus was composed of a set of 47 utterances, chosen randomly from a corpus of transcribed spoken Swedish containing 267,206 words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="79:98	4 Results The number of correctly tagged word tokens under condition 1 was 1153 out of a total of 1360, i. e., 84.8./o. The results for condition 2 were slightly better: 1248/1457 = 85.7%." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="14:171	Many people do this, but one cannot help feeling that something is being missed; intuitively, there are many domain-independent grammatical constraints, which one would prefer only to need to code once." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:171	In the last ten years, there have been a number of attempts to find ways to automatically adapt a general grammar and/or parser to the sub-language defined by a suitable training corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="45:171	2 Constituent Pruning Before both the phrasal and full parsing stages, the constituent table (henceforth, the chart) is pruned to remove edges that are relatively unlikely to contribute to correct analyses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:171	For example, after the string 'Show flight D L three one two' is lexically analysed, edges for 'D' and 'L' as individual characters are pruned because another edge, derived from a lexical entry for 'D L' as an airline code, is deemed far more plausible." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:171	This edge is deemed far more likely to serve as the basis for a correct full parse than any of the edges spanning substrings of this phrase; those edges, too, are therefore pruned." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="52:171	2.1 The pruning algorithm Our algorithm estimates the probability of correctness of each edge: that is, the probability that the edge will contribute to the correct full analysis of the sentence (assuming there is one), given certain lexical and/or syntactic information about it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:171	Values on each criterion (selection of pieces of information) are derived from training corpora by maximum likelihood estimation followed by smoothing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:171	That is, our estimate for the probability that an edge with property P is correct is (modulo smoothing) simply the number of times edges with property P occur in correct analyses in training divided by the number of times such edges are created during the analysis process in training." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:171	The current criteria are:  The left bigram score: the probability of correctness of an edge considering only the following data about it: its tag (corresponding to its major category symbol plus, for a few categories, some ad224 ditional distinctions derived from feature values); for a lexical edge, its word or semantic word class (words with similar distributions, such as city names, are grouped into classes to overcome data sparseness); or for a phrasal edge, the name of the final (topmost) grammar rule that was used to create it; the tag of a neighbouring edge immediately to its left." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:171	If there are several left neighbours, the one giving the highest probability is used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:171	 The right bigram score: as above, but considering right neighbours." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:171	 The unigram score: the probability of correctness of an edge considering only the tree of grammar rules, with words or word classes at the leaves, that gave rise to it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:171	For a lexical edge, this reduces to its word or word class, and its tag." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:171	Other criteria, such as trigrams and finer-grained tags, are obviously worth investigating, and could be applied straightforwardly within the framework described here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:171	The minimum score derived from any of the criteria applied is deemed initially to be the score of the constituent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:171	That is, an assumption of full statistical dependence (Yarowsky, 1994), rather than the more common full independence, is made3 When llf events El, E2,, E,~ are fully independent, then the joint probability P(E1 A A En) is the product of P(EI)P(En), but if they are maximally dependent, it is the minimum of these values." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:171	Of course, neither assumption is any more than an approximation to the truth; but assuming dependence has the advantage that the estimate of the joint probability depends much less strongly on n, and so estimates for alternative joint events can be directly compared, without any possibly tricky normalization, even if they are composed of different numbers of atomic events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:171	This property is desirable: different (sub-)paths through a chart may span different numbers of edges, and one can imagine evaluation criteria which are only defined for some kinds of edge, or which often duplicate information supplied by other criteria." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:171	Taking minima means that the pruning of an edge results from it scoring poorly on one criterion, regardless of other, possibly good scores assigned to it by other criteria." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:171	This fits in with the fact that on the basis of local information alone it is not usually possibly to predict with confidence that a particular edge is highly likely to contribute to the correct analysis (since global factors will also be important) but it often is possible to spot highly unlikely edges." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:171	In other words, our training procedure yields far more probability estimates close to zero than close to one." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:171	recognizer output is being processed, however, the estimate from each criterion is in fact multiplied by a further estimate derived from the acoustic score of the edge: that is, the score assigned by the speech recognizer to the best-scoring sentence hypothesis containing the word or word string for the edge in question." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:171	Multiplication is used here because acoustic and lexicosyntactic likelihoods for a word or constituent would appear to be more nearly fully independent than fully dependent, being based on very different kinds of information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:171	Next, account is taken of the connectivity of the chart." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:171	Each vertex of the chart is labelled with the score of the best path through the chart that visits that vertex." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:171	In accordance with the dependence assumption, the score of a path is defined as the minimum of the scores of its component edges." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:171	Then the score of each edge is recalculated to be the minimum of its existing score and the scores of its start and end vertices, on the grounds that a constituent, however intrinsically plausible, is not worth preserving if it does not occur on any plausible paths." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:171	Finally, a pruning threshold is calculated as the score of the best path through the chart multiplied by a certain fraction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:171	For the first pruning phase we use 1/20, and for the second, 1/150, although performance is not very sensitive to this." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:171	Any constituents scoring less than the threshold are pruned out." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:171	2.2 Relation to other pruning methods As the example above suggests, judicious pruning of the chart at appropriate points can greatly restrict the search space and speed up processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:171	Our method has points of similarity with some very recent work in Constraint Grammar 2 and is an alternative to several other, related schemes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:171	Firstly, a remarked earlier, it generalizes tagging: it not only adjudicates between possible labels for the same word, but can also use the existence of a constituent over one span of the chart as justification for pruning another constituent over another span, normally a subsumed one, as in the 'D L' example." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:171	This is especially true in the second stage of pruning, when many constituents of different lengths have been created." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:171	Furthermore, it applies equally well to lattices, rather than strings, of words, and can take account of acoustic plausibility as well as syntactic considerations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:171	Secondly, our method is related to beam search (Woods, 1985)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:171	In beam search, incomplete parses of an utterance are pruned or discarded when, on 2Ghrister Samuelsson, personal communication, 8th April 1996; see (Karlsson et al. , 1995) for background." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:171	225 some criterion, they are significantly less plausible than other, competing parses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:171	This pruning is fully interleaved with the parsing process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:171	In contrast, our pruning takes place only at certain points: currently before parsing begins, and between the phrasM and full parsing stages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:171	Potentially, as with any generate-and-test algorithm, this can mean efficiency is reduced: some paths will be explored that could in principle be pruned earlier." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:171	However, as the results in section 4 below will show, this is not in practice a serious problem, because the second pruning phase greatly reduces the search space in preparation for the potentially inefficient full parsing phase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:171	Our method has the advantage, compared to beam search, that there is no need for any particular search order to be followed; when pruning takes place, all constituents that could have been found at the stage in question are guaranteed already to exist." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:171	Thirdly, our method is a generalization of the strategy employed by (McCord, 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:171	McCord interleaved parsing with pruning in the same way as us, but only compared constituents over the same span and with the same major category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:171	Our comparisons are more global and therefore can result in more effective pruning." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:171	3 Grammar specialization As described in Section 1 above, the non-phrasal grammar rules are subjected to two phases of processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:171	In the first, 'EBL learning' phase, a parsed training corpus is used to identify 'chunks' of rules, which are combined by the EBL algorithm into single macro-rules." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="11:213	1 Introduction In the part-of-speech hterature, whether taggers are based on a rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons, 1963), (Brill, 1992), (Voutilainen, 1993), or on a statistical one (Bahl and Mercer, 1976), (Leech et al. , 1983), (Merialdo, 1994), (DeRose, 1988), (Church, 1989), (Cutting et al. , 1992), there is a debate as to whether more attention should be paid to lexical probabilities rather than contextual ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:213	(Church, 1992) claims that part-of-speech taggers depend almost exclusively on lexical probabilities, whereas other researchers, such as Voutilainen (Karlsson et al. , 1995) argue that word ambiguities vary widely in function of the specific text and genre." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:213	Indeed, part of Church's argument is relevant if a system is based on a large corpus such as the Brown corpus (Francis and Ku~era, 1982) which represents one million surface forms of morpho-syntacticaJly disambiguated words from a range of balanced texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:213	Consider, for example, a word like 'cover' as discussed by Voutilainen (Karlsson et al. , 1995): in the Brown and the LOB Corpus (Johansson, 1980), the word 'cover' is a noun 40% of the occurrences and a verb 60% of the other, but in the context of a car maintenance manual, it is a noun 100~0 of the time." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:213	Since, for statistical taggers, 90% of texts can be disambiguated solely applying lexical probabilities, it is, in fact, tempting to think that with more data and more accurate lexical estimates, more text could be better disambiguated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:213	If this hypothesis is true for English, we show that it does not hold for languages for which publicly available tagged corpora do not exist." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:213	We also argue against Church's position, supporting the claim that more attention needs to be paid to contextual information for part-of-speech disambiguation (Tzoukermann et ai., 1995)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="21:213	Consequently, the problem of extracting lexical probabilities from a small training corpus is twofold: first, the statistical model may not necessarily represent the use of a particular word in a particular context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:213	In a morphologically inflected language, this argument is particularly serious since a word can be tagged with a large number of parts of speech, i.e. the ambiguity potential is high." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="10:265	However, in order to build an accurate stochastic language model, large amounts of tagged text are needed and a tagged corpus may not always match a target application because of, for example, differences between the tag systems." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:179	After description of the tag system used, we show the results of four experiments using a simple probabilistic model to tag Czech texts (unigram, two bigram experiments, and a trigram one)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:179	For comparison, we have applied the same code and settings to tag an English text (another four experiments) using the same size of training and test data in the experiments in order to avoid any doubt concerning the validity of the comparison." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:179	The experiments use the source channel model and maximum likelihood training on a Czech handtagged corpus and on tagged Wall Street Journal (WSJ) from the LDC collection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:179	The experiments show (not surprisingly) that the more training data, the better is the success rate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:179	The results also indicate that for inflective languages with 1000+ tags we have to develop a more sophisticated approach in order to get closer to an acceptable error rate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:179	In order to compare two different approaches to text tagging -statistical and rule-based -we modified Eric Brill's rule-based part of speech tagger and carried out two more experiments on the Czech data, obtaining similar results in terms of the error rate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:179	We have also run three more experiments with greatly reduced tagset to get another comparison based on similar tagset size." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:179	1 INTRODUCTION Languages with rich inflection like Czech pose a special problem for morphological disambiguation (which is usually called tagging1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:179	For example, the ending '-u' is not only highly ambiguous, but at the same time it carries complex information: it corresponds to the genitive, the dative and the locative singular for inanimate nouns, or the dative singular for animate nouns, or the accusative singular for feminine nouns, or the first person singular present tense active participle for certain verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:179	There are two different techniques for text tagging: a stochastic technique and a rule-based technique." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:179	Each approach has some advantages -for stochastic techniques there exists a good theoretical framework, probabilities provide a straightforward way how to disambiguate tags for each word and probabilities can be acquired automatically from the data; for rule-based techniques the set of meaningful rules is automatically acquired and there exists an easy way how to find and implement improvements of the tagger." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:179	Small set of rules can be used, in contrast to the large statistical tables." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:179	Given the success of statistical methods in different areas, including text tagging, given the very positive results of English statistical taggers and given the fact that there existed no statistical tagger for any Slavic language we wanted to apply statistical methods even for the Czech language although it exhibits a rich inflection accompanied by a high degree of ambiguity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:179	Originally, we expected that the result would be plain negative, getting no more than about two thirds of the tags correct." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:179	However, as we show below, we got better results than we had expected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:179	We used the same statistical approach to tag both the English text and the Czech text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:179	For English, we obtained results comparable with the results presented in (Merialdo, 1992) as well as in (Church, 1992)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:179	For Czech, we obtained results which are less satisfactory than those for English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:179	Given the comparability of the accuracy of the rule-based part-of-speech (POS) tagger (Brill, 1992) with the accuracy of the stochastic tagIThe development of automatic tagging of Czech is/was supported fully or partially by the following grants/projects: Charles University GAUK 39/94, Grant Agency of the Czech Republic GACR 405/96/K214 and Ministry of Education VS96151." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="123:179	This is especially true when comparing it to English, where some tags represent, in fact, a set of tags to be discriminated later (if ever)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="130:179	However, it can be quite simply derived from the tables 2.10, 2.11a and 2.11b, that the error rate would not drop much: it will remain high at about 6.5070 (based on the results of experiment No. 4) using the very small tagset of 12 (= number or lines in table 2.11a) tags used for part of speech identification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="131:179	This is even much higher than the error rate reported here for the smallest tagset used in the 'pure' experiment (sect." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="12:319	However, some domain-specific words or infrequently used morphological variants of general-purpose words can be missing from the lexicon and thus, their POs-classes should be guessed by the system and only then sent to the disambiguation module." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:319	The simplest approach to POS-class guessing is either to assign all possible tags to an unknown word or to assign the most probable one, which is proper singular noun for capitalized words and common singular noun otherwise." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="9:184	Discussion: Potential applications of this approach are discussed, namely terminology acquisition, information retrieval, and genre characterization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:184	1 Introduction In previous studies, we demonstrated the feasibility of using NLP techniques such as shallow parsing of adjectival modification for identifying hierarchical relations among biomedical terms (Bodenreider et al. , 2001) and for extending an existing biomedical terminology (Bodenreider et al. , 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:184	In these studies, the corpus was biomedical terminology or phrases extracted from the biomedical literature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:184	Other authors have explored adjectival modification in a clinical corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:184	Chute and Elkin (1997) note, based on empirical observation of clinical data, that many clinical terms are accompanied by modifiers, including adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:184	The authors make a distinction between clinical modifiers (such as chronic, severe, and acute) and operational or administrative qualifiers (such as no evidence of, history of, and status post)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:184	It appears that the class of clinical modifiers consists primarily of adjectives that provide specific information regarding condition and are distributed on a scale." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:184	They suggest that operational modifiers be kept separate from the terms themselves in order to avoid combinatorial explosion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:184	Taking this idea one step further, we believe that, besides operational modifiers, other adjectives encountered in clinical phrases could receive a special treatment in applications such as information retrieval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:184	For example, adjectives expressing nuances useful only in the context of clinical care could be removed from the phrase when searching the biomedical literature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:184	This is the case of adjectives expressing degree of certainty (e.g. , probable)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:184	In other cases, adjectives specific to clinical phrases can be mapped to synonyms or closely related modifiers (e.g. , greenish sputum, green sputum)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:184	The ability to map stylistic variations of the same adjective becomes especially important to establishing links between clinical records and scientific literature, which actually has significant implications for improving patient care in clinical practice as well as health science research." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:184	Finally, adjectives absent from the biomedical literature or terminologies may denote recent phenomena, not yet integrated in terminologies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:184	Knowledge about these classes of adjectives may help map across genres." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:184	Conversely, studying adjectival modification across genres may help identify adjectives whose representation varies across genres, possibly denoting one of these phenomena." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:184	In the present paper, we explore the phenomenon of adjectival modification across two genres: the biomedical literature and patient records." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:184	The expected outcome of this study is to obtain a better characterization of adjectival modification in biomedical phrases of various origins, in order to fully take advantage of this phenomenon in applications such as the automatic construction of terminology and ontology resources and the retrieval of clinical documents." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="28:184	Most approaches have been directed at creating adjective taxonomies and other ways of classifying and representing adjectives according to their properties and function." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:184	Raskin and Niernburg (1995) provide a comprehensive overview of the various approaches that have been taken to description, classification and representation of adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:184	From the NLP standpoint, Fellbaum (1993) partitions adjectives in WordNet 1 into two large classes: descriptive and relational." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:184	Descriptive adjectives ascribe a value of an attribute to a noun (p.27) (i.e. , big child) while relational adjectives are usually derived from and are somehow associated with a noun (i.e. , musical child)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:184	Another prominent distinction has to do with whether an adjective can express continuous (scalar) or discrete (non-scalar) values." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:184	Raskin and Niernburg (1996) point out that for text meaning representa1 www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/ tion for computational semantics, the most important distinction to make is between scalar and nonscalar." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:184	They also present a method for incorporating the semantics of the modifier adjective into the semantics of the modified noun by representing nouns as frames with elements such as ATTRIBUTE_SIZE than can be filled in by the semantic content of the modifying adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:184	The major contribution of this study is to explore adjectival modification across two genres in the biomedical domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:184	Our approach is essentially practical and oriented towards applied perspectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:184	3 Resources The two genres compared in this study are the biomedical literature and patient records." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:184	More precisely, we use MEDLINE as our bibliographic corpus and clinical notes recorded at the Mayo Clinic as our clinical corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:98	1 Introduction Having reliable part-of-speech (POS) information is critical to successful implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for processing unrestricted text in the biomedical domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:98	State-of-the-art automated POS taggers achieve accuracy of 93% 98% and the most successful implementations are based on statistical approaches to POS tagging." ></td>
	<td class="line p" title="7:98	Taggers based on Hidden Markoff Model (HMM) technology currently appear to be in the lead." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="8:98	The prime public domain examples of such implementations include the TrigramsnTags tagger (Brandts 2000), Xerox tagger (Cutting et al. 1992) and LT POS tagger (Mikheev 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:98	Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based taggers also seem to perform very well (Ratnaparkhi 1996, Jason Baldridge, Tom Morton, and Gann Bierner http://maxent.sourceforge.net )." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:98	One of the issues with statistical POS taggers is that most of them need a representative amount of hand-labeled training data either in the form of a comprehensive lexicon and a corpus of untagged data or a large corpus of text annotated for POS or a combination of the two." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:98	Currently, most of the POS tagger accuracy reports are based on the experiments involving Penn Treebank data (Marcus, 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:98	The texts in Treebank represent the general English domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:98	It is not entirely clear how representative the general English language vocabulary and structure are of a specialized subdomain such as clinical reports." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:98	A well-recognized problem is that the accuracy of all current POS taggers drops dramatically on unknown words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:98	For example, while the TnT tagger performs at 97% accuracy on known words in the Treebank, the accuracy drops to 89% on unknown words (Brandts, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:98	The LT POS tagger is reported to perform at 93.6-94.3% accuracy on known words and at 87.7-88.7% on unknown words using a cascading unknown word guesser (Mikheev, 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:98	The overall results for both of these taggers are much closer to the high end of the spectrum because the rate of the unknown words in the tests performed on the Penn Treebank corpus is generally relatively low  2.9% (Brandts, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:98	From these results, we can conclude that the higher the rate of unknown vocabulary, the lower the overall accuracy will be, necessitating the adaptation of the taggers trained on Penn Treebank to sublanguage domains with vocabulary that is substantially different from the one represented by the Penn Treebank corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:98	Based on the observable differences between the clinical and the general English discourse and POS tagging accuracy results on unknown vocabulary, it is reasonable to assume that a tagger trained on general English may not perform as well on clinical notes, where the percentage of unknown words will increase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:98	To test this assumption, a gold standard corpus of clinical notes needs to be manually annotated for POS information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:98	The issues with the annotation process constitute the primary focus of this paper." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:98	We describe an effort to train three medical coding experts to mark the text of clinical notes for part-of-speech information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:98	The motivation for using medical coders rather than trained linguists is threefold." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:98	First of all, due to confidentiality restrictions, in order to develop a corpus of hand labeled data from clinical notes one can only use personnel authorized to access patient information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:98	The only way to avoid it, is to anonymize the notes prior to POS tagging which in itself is a difficult and expensive process (Ruch et al. 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:98	Second, medical coding experts are well familiar with 62 clinical discourse, which helps especially with annotating medicine specific vocabulary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:98	Third, the fact that POS tagging can be viewed as a classification task makes the medical coding experts highly suitable because their primary occupation and expertise is in classifying patient records for subsequent retrieval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:98	We show that, given a good set of guidelines, medical coding experts can be trained in a limited amount of time to perform a linguistic task such as POS annotation at a high level of agreement on both clinical notes and Penn Treebank data." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="95:98	In other words, can we achieve state-of-the-art performance in a specialized domain by simply adding the vocabulary from the domain to the POS taggers lexicon?" ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="4:214	We describe a technique of this nature called information theoretic co-clustering and give results of a series of experiments built around it that demonstrate the main ingredients of lexical optimization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:214	We conclude by describing our plans for further improvements, and for applying the same mathematical principles to other problems in natural language processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:214	1 Introduction A lexicon is a key resource for natural language processing, providing the link between the terms of a language and the semantic and syntactic properties with which they are associated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:214	Like most resources of considerable value, a good lexicon can be dif cult or expensive to obtain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:214	This is particularly true if the lexicon needs to be specialized to a technical subject, an obscure language or dialect, or a highly idiomatic writing style." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:214	Motivated by the practical importance of these cases as well as the theoretical interest inherent to the problem, we have set out to develop methods for building a lexicon automatically, given only a corpus of text representative of the domain of interest." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:214	We represent the semantics of a term by an associated probability distribution over what we call a grounding space, which we de ne in various relatively conventional ways involving terms that occur in text in the vicinity of the term in question." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:214	It is well-known that such distributions can represent meaning reasonably well, at least for meaning-comparison purposes (Landauer and Dumais, 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:214	We add to this framework the notion that the more information such a distributional lexicon can capture, the more useful it is. This provides us with a mathematical concept of lexical optimization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:214	We begin the lexicon construction process by applying a distributional clustering technique called information theoretic co-clustering to make a rst pass at grouping the most frequent terms in the corpus according to their most common syntactic part of speech category, as described in Section 2 along with illustrative results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:214	We brie y describe the co-clustering algorithm in Section 2.1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:214	In Section 3.1, we show that novel terms can be sensibly assigned to previously de ned clusters using the same information theoretic criterion that the co-clustering uses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:214	Even though term clustering crudely ignores the fact that a terms part of speech generally varies with its context, it is clear from inspection that the clusters themselves correspond to corpus-adapted part-of-speech categories, and can be used as such." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:214	In Section 3.2, we examine two approaches to incorporating context information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:214	The most direct is to partition the contexts in which a term occurs into classes according to the informatic criterion used in co-clustering, creating sense-disambiguated word-with-context-class pseudo-terms." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="23:214	While part of speech is a somewhat uid notion, the computational linguistics community has converged on a handful of standard tag sets, and taggers are now available in a number of languages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:214	Since some high-quality taggers are in the public domain, any application that could bene t from part-of-speech information should have access to it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:214	However, using a speci c tagger and its tag set entails adopting the assumptions it embodies, which may not be appropriate for the target application." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="29:214	Fortunately, using distributional characteristics of term contexts, it is feasible to induce part-of-speech categories directly from a corpus of suf cient size, as several papers have made clear (Brown et al. , 1992; Schcurrency1utze, 1993; Clark, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:214	Distributional information has uses beyond part of speech induction." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="34:214	2.1 The Co-clustering Algorithm." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="37:214	We achieve this in the framework of information theoretic co-clustering (Dhillon et al. , 2003), in which a space of entities, on the one hand, and their contexts, on the other, are alternately clustered in a way that maximizes mutual information between the two spaces." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:214	By treating the space of terms and the space of contexts as separate, we part ways with Brown, et al. This allows us to experiment with the notion of context, as well as to investigate whether pooling contexts is useful, as has been assumed." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="4:160	1 Introduction Many natural language processing tasks consist of labeling sequences of words with linguistic annotations, e.g. word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and others." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:160	Typical labeling algorithms attempt to formulate the annotation task as a traditional learning problem, where the correct label is individually determined for each word in the sequence using a learning process, usually conducted independent of the labels assigned to the other words in the sequence." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="21:197	Although there are POS error detection approaches, using, e.g., anomaly detection (Eskin, 2000), our approach builds on the variation n-gram algorithm introduced in Dickinson and Meurers (2003) and Dickinson (2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:197	As we will show in section 5, such a method is useful for correction because it highlights recurring problematic tag distinctions in the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:197	The idea behind the variation n-gram approach is that a string occurring more than once can occur with different labels in a corpus, which is referred to as variation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:197	Variation is caused by one of two reasons: i) ambiguity: there is a type of string with multiple possible labels and different corpus occurrences of that string realize the different options, or ii) error: the tagging of a string is inconsistent across comparable occurrences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:197	The more similar the context of a variation, the more likely the variation is an error." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:197	In Dickinson and Meurers (2003), contexts are composed of words, and identity of the context is required." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:197	The term variation n-gram refers to an n-gram (of words) in a corpus that contains a string annotated differently in another occurrence of the same ngram in the corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="30:197	(1) to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns Once the variation n-grams for a corpus have been computed, heuristics are employed to classify the variations into errors and ambiguities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:197	The most effective heuristic takes into account the fact that natural languages favor the use of local dependencies over non-local ones: nuclei found at the fringe of an n-gram are more likely to be genuine ambiguities than those occurring with at least one word of surrounding context." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="52:197	This approach hinges on high-quality error detection since in general we cannot assume that discrepancies between a POS tagger and the benchmark are errors in the benchmark." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="56:197	Both taggers use probabilistic contextual and lexical information to disambiguate a tag at a particular corpus position." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="179:197	In example (11), along with the fact that this is 13 years later as compared to now (i.e. , comparative), one can say Now, (even) 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist  , favoring RBR as a tag." ></td>
