Two Languages Are More Informative Than One

	<td class="line x" title="2:208	This approach exploits the differences between mappings of words to senses in different languages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:208	We concentrate on the problem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable, and employ a statistical model for the selection mechanism." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:208	The model was evaluated using two sets of Hebrew and German examples and was found to be very useful for disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:208	1 Introduction The resolution of hxical ambiguities in non-restricted text is one of the most difficult tasks of natural language processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:208	A related task in machine translation is target word selection the task of deciding which target language word is the most appropriate equivalent of a source language word in context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:208	In addition to the alternatives introduced from the different word senses of the source language word, the target language may specify additional alternatives that differ mainly in their usages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:208	Traditionally various linguistic levels were used to deal with this problem: syntactic, semantic and pragmatic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:208	Computationally the syntactic methods are the easiest, but are of no avail in the frequent situation when the different senses of the word show *This research was partially supported by grant number 120-741 of the Iarael Council for Research and Development the same syntactic behavior, having the same part of speech and even the same subcategorization frame." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:208	Substantial application of semantic or pragmatic knowledge about the word and its context for broad domains requires compiling huge amounts of knowledge, whose usefulness for practical applications has not yet been proven (Lenat et al. , 1990; Nirenburg et al. , 1988; Chodorow et al. , 1985)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:208	Moreover, such methods fail to reflect word usages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:208	It is known for many years that the use of a word in the language provides information about its meaning (Wittgenstein, 1953)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:208	Also, statistical approaches which were popular few decades ago have recently reawakened and were found useful for computational linguistics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:208	Consequently, a possible (though partial) alternative to using manually constructed knowledge can be found in the use of statistical data on the occurrence of lexical relations in large corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="15:208	The use of such relations (mainly relations between verbs or nouns and their arguments and modifiers) for various purposes has received growing attention in recent research (Church and Hanks, 1990; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Hindle, 1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:208	More specifically, two recent works have suggested to use statistical data on lexical relations for resolving ambiguity cases of PP-attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1990) and pronoun references (Dagan and Itai, 1990a; Dagan and Itai, 1990b)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:208	Clearly, statistical methods can be useful also for target word selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:208	Consider, for example, the Hebrew sentence extracted from the foreign news section of the daily Haaretz, September 1990 (transcripted to Latin letters)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:208	130 (1) Nose ze maria' mi-shtei ha-mdinot mi-lahtom 'al hoze shalom." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:208	This sentence would translate into English as: (2) That issue prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:208	The verb 'lab_tom' has four word senses: 'sign', 'seal', 'finish' and 'close'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:208	Whereas the noun 'hose' means both 'contract' and 'treaty'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:208	Here the difference is not in the meaning, but in usage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:208	One possible solution is to consult a Hebrew corpus tagged with word senses, from which we would probably learn that the sense 'sign' of 'lahtom' appears more frequently with 'hoze' as its object than all the other senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:208	Thus we should prefer that sense." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:208	However, the size of corpora required to identify lexical relations in a broad domain is huge (tens of millions of words) and therefore it is usually not feasible to have such corpora manually tagged with word senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:208	The problem of choosing between 'treaty' and 'contract' cannot be solved using only information on Hebrew, because Hebrew does not distinguish between them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:208	The solution suggested in this paper is to identify the lexical relationships in corpora of the target language, instead of the source language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:208	Consulting English corpora of 150 million words, yields the following statistics on single word frequencies: 'sign' appeared 28674 times, 'seal' 2771 times, 'finish' appeared 15595 times, 'close' 38291 times, 'treaty' 7331 times and 'contract' 30757 times." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:208	Using a naive approach of choosing the most frequent word yields (3) *That issue prevented the two countries from closing a peace contract." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:208	This may be improved upon if we use lexical relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:208	We consider word combinations and count how often they appeared in the same syntactic relation as in the ambiguous sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:208	For the above example, among the successfully parsed sentences of the corpus, the noun compound 'peace treaty' appeared 49 times, whereas the compound 'peace contract' did not appear at all; 'to sign a treaty' appeared 79 times while none of the other three alternatives appeared more than twice." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:208	Thus we first prefer 'treaty' to 'contract' because of the noun compound 'peace treaty' and then proceed to prefer 'sign' since it appears most frequently having the object 'treaty' (the order of selection is explained in section 3)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:208	Thus in this case our method yielded the correct translation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:208	Using this method, we take the point of view that some ambiguity problems are easier to solve at the level of the target language instead of the source language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:208	The source language sentences are considered as a noisy source for target language sentences, and our task is to devise a target language model that prefers the most reasonable translation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:208	Machine translation (MT) is thus viewed in part as a recognition problem, and the statistical model we use specifically for target word selection may be compared with other language models in recognition tasks (e.g. Katz (1985) for speech recognition)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:208	In contrast to this view, previous approaches in MT typically resolved examples like (1) by stating various constraints in terms of the source language (Nirenburg, 1987)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:208	As explained before, such constraints cannot be acquired automatically and therefore are usually limited in their coverage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:208	The experiment conducted to test the statistical model clearly shows that the statistics on lexical relations are very useful for disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:208	Most notable is the result for the set of examples for Hebrew to English translation, which was picked randomly from foreign news sections in Israeli press." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:208	For this set, the statistical model was applicable for 70% of the ambiguous words, and its selection was then correct for 92% of the cases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:208	These results for target word selection in machine translation suggest to use a similar mechanism even if we are interested only in word sense disambiguation within a single language!" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:208	In order to select the right sense of a word, in a broad coverage application, it is useful to identify lexical relations between word senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:208	However, within corpora of a single language it is possible to identify automatically only relations at the word level, which are of course not useful for selecting word senses in that language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:208	This is where other languages can supply the solution, exploiting the fact that the mapping between words and word senses varies significantly among different languages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:208	For instance, the English words 'sign' and 'seal' correspond to a very large extent to two distinct senses of the Hebrew word 'lab_tom' (from example (1))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:208	These senses should be distinguished by most applications of Hebrew understanding programs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:208	To make this distinction, it is possible to do the same process that is performed for target word selection, by producing all the English alternatives for the lexical relations involving 'lahtom'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:208	Then the Hebrew sense which corresponds to the most plausible English lexical relations is preferred." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:208	This process requires a bilingual lexicon which maps each Hebrew sense separately into its possible translations, similar 131 to a Hebrew-Hebrew-English lexicon (like the Oxford English-English-Hebrew dictionary (Hornby et al. , 1980))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:208	In some cases, different senses of a Hebrew word map to the same word also in English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:208	In these cases, the lexical relations of each sense cannot be identified in an English corpus, and a third language is required to distinguish among these senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:208	As a long term vision, one can imagine a multilingual corpora based system, which exploits the differences between languages to automatically acquire knowledge about word senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:208	As explained above, this knowledge would be crucial for lexical disambiguation, and will also help to refine other types of knowledge acquired from large corpora 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:208	2 The Linguistic Model The ambiguity of a word is determined by the number of distinct, non-equivalent representations into which the word can be mapped (Van Eynde et al. , 1982)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:208	In the case of machine translation the ambiguity of a source word is thus given by the number of target representations for that word in the bilingual lexicon of the translation system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:208	Given a specific syntactic context the ambiguity can be reduced to the number of alternatives which may appear in that context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:208	For instance, if a certain translation of a verb corresponds to an intransitive occurrence of that verb, then this possibility is eliminated when the verb occurs with a direct object." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:208	In this work we are interested only in those ambiguities that are left after applying all the deterministic syntactic constraints." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:208	For example, consider the following Hebrew sentence, taken from the daily Haaretz, September 1990: (4) Diplomatim svurim ki hitztarrfuto shell Hon Sun magdila et ha.sikkuyim l-hassagat hitqaddmut ba-sihot." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:208	Here, the ambiguous words in translation to English are 'magdila', 'hitqaddmut' and 'sih_ot'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:208	To facilitate the reading, we give the translation of the sentence to English, and in each case of an ambiguous selection all the alternatives are listed within curly brackets, the first alternative being the correct one." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="66:208	132 (5) Diplomats believe that the joining of Hon Sun { increases I enlarges I magnifies } the chances for achieving { progress \[ advance I advancement } in the { talks I conversations I calls }." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:208	We use the term a lezical relation to denote the cooccurrence relation of two (or possibly more) specific words in a sentence, having a certain syntactic relationship between them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:208	Typical relations are between verbs and their subjects, objects, complements, adverbs and modifying prepositional phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:208	Similarly, nouns are related also with their objects, with their modifying nouns in compounds and with their modifying adjectives and prepositional phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:208	The relational representation of a sentence is simply the list of all lexical relations that occur in the sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:208	For our purpose, the relational representation contains only those relations that involve at least one ambiguous word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:208	The relational representation for example (4) is given in (6) (for readability we represent the Hebrew word by its English equivalent, prefixed by 'H' to denote the fact that it is a Hebrew word): (6) a." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="75:208	(verb-obj: H-achieve H-progress) d." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:208	(noun-pp: H-progress H-in H-talks) The relational representation of a source sentence is reflected also in its translation to a target sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:208	In some cases the relational representation of the target sentence is completely equivalent to that of the source sentence, and can be achieved just by substituting the source words with target words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:208	In other cases, the mapping between source and target relations is more complicated, as is the case for the following German example: (7) Der Tisch gefaellt mir." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:208	-I like the table." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:208	Here, the original subject of the source sentence becomes the object in the target sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:208	This kind of mapping usually influences the translation process and is therefore encoded in components of the translation program, either explicitly or implicitly, especially in transfer based systems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:208	Our model assumes that such a mapping of source language relations to target language relations is possible, an assumption that is valid for many practical cases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:208	When applying the mapping of relations on one lexicai relation of the source sentence we get several alternatives for a target relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:208	For instance, applying the mapping to example (6-c) we get three alternatives for the relation in the target sentence: (8) (verb-obj: achieve progress) (verb-obj: achieve advance) (verb-obj: achieve advancement) For example (6-d) we get 9 alternatives, since both 'H-progress' and 'H-talks' have three alternative translations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:208	In order to decide which alternative is the most probable, we count the frequencies of all the alternative target relations in very large corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:208	For example (8) we got the counts 20, 5 and 1 respectively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:208	Similarly, the target relation 'to increase chance' was counted 20 times, while the other alternatives were not observed at all." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:208	These counts are given as input to the statistical model described in the next section, which performs the actual target word selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:208	3 The Statistical Model Our selection algorithm is based on the following statistical model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:208	Consider first a single relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:208	The linguistic model provides us with several alternatives as in example (8)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:208	We assume that each alternative has a theoretical probability Pi to be appropriate for this case." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:208	We wish to select the alternative for which Pi is maximal, provided that it is significantly larger than the others." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:208	We have decided to measure this significance by the odds ratio of the two most probable alternatives P = Pl/P2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:208	However, we do not know the theoretical probabilities, therefore we get a bound for p using the frequencies of the alternatives in the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:208	Let/3 i be the probabilities as observed in the corpus (101 = ni/n, where ni is the number of times that alternative i appeared in the corpus and n is the total number of times that all the alternatives for the relation appeared in the corpus)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:208	For mathematical convenience we bound In p instead of p. Assuming that samples of the alternative relations are distributed normally, we get the following bound with confidence 1 a: where Z is the eonfidenee coefficient." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:208	We approximate the variance by the delta method (e.g. Johnson and Wichern (1982)): =,n _ 1 p~(1 p~) -) 1 p~(1 p~) + 2 P*P~ p~ n p~ n npxI~ 1 1 1 1 1 1 = + ~, + =~+~." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="100:208	In sentences with several relations, we consider the best two alternatives for each relation, and take the relation for which B,, is largest." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:208	If this Ba is less than a specified threshold then we do not choose between the alternatives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:208	Otherwise, we choose the most frequent alternative to this relation and select the target words appearing in this alternative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:208	We then eliminate all the other alternative translations for the selected words, and accordingly eliminate all the alternatives for the remaining relations which involve these translations." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="105:208	This procedure is repeated until all target words have been determined or the maximal Ba is below the threshold." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:208	The actual parameters we have used so far were c~ = 0.05 and the bound for Bawas -0.5." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:208	To illustrate the selection algorithm, we give the details for example (6)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:208	The highest bound for the odds ratio (Ba = 1.36) was received for the relation 'increase-chance', thus selecting the translation 'increase' for 'H-increase'." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="117:208	These cases included very rare or archaic translations (that would not be contained in an MT lexicon) and alternatives that could be eliminated using syntactic knowledge (as explained in section 2) 2 . For each of the remaining alternatives, it was judged if it can serve as an acceptable translation in the given context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="118:208	This a priori judgment was used later to decide whether the selection of the automatic procedure is correct." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="119:208	As a result of this process, the Hebrew set contained 105 ambiguous words (which had at least one unacceptable translation) and the German set 54 ambiguous words." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="158:208	In this case it is possible to perform the correct selection if we used only statistics about the cooccurrences of 'corruption' with either 'investigator' or 'researcher', without looking for any syntactic relation (as in Church and Hanks (1990))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="159:208	The use of this statistic is a subject for further research, but our initial data suggests that it can substantially increase the applicability of the statistical method with just a little decrease in its precision." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="160:208	Another way to deal with the lack of statistical data for the specific words in question is to use statistics about similar words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="161:208	This is the basis for Sadler's Analogical Semantics (1989) which has not yet proved effective." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="162:208	His results may be improved if more sophisticated techniques and larger corpora are used to establish similarity between words (such as in (Hindle, 1990))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="163:208	Conflicting data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="164:208	In very few cases two alternatives were supported equally by the statistical data, thus preventing a selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="165:208	In such cases, both alternatives are valid at the independent level of the lexical relation, but may be inappropriate for the specific context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="166:208	For instance, the two alternatives of 'to take 135 a job' or 'to take a position' appeared in one of the examples, but since the general context concerned with the position of a prime minister only the latter was appropriate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="167:208	In order to resolve such examples it may be useful to consider also cooccurrences of the ambiguous word with other words in the broader context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="168:208	For instance, the word 'minister' seems to cooccur in the same context more frequently with 'position' than with 'job'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="169:208	In another example both alternatives were appropriate also for the specific context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="170:208	This happened with the German verb 'werfen', which may be translated (among other options) as 'throw', 'cast' or 'score'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="171:208	In our example 'werfen' appeared in the context of 'to throw/cast light' and these two correct alternatives had equal frequencies in the corpus ('score' was successfully eliminated)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="172:208	In such situations any selection between the alternatives will be appropriate and therefore any algorithm that handles conflicting data will work properly." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="173:208	6.2 Incorrect Selection Using the inappropriate relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="174:208	One of the examples contained the Hebrew word 'matzav', which two of its possible translations are 'state' and 'position'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="175:208	The phrase which contained this word was: 'to put an end to the {state I position} of war  '." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="176:208	The ambiguous word is involved in two syntactic relations, being a complement of 'put' and also modified by 'war'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="177:208	The corresponding frequencies were: (9) verb-comp: put-position 320 verb-comp: put-state 18 noun-nob j: state-war 13 noun-nob j: position-war 2 The bound of the odds ration (Ba) for the first relation was higher than for the second, and therefore this relation determined the translation as 'position'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="178:208	However, the correct translation should be 'state', as determined by the second relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="179:208	This example suggests that while ordering the involved relations (or using any other weighting mechanism) it may be necessary to give different weights to the different types of syntactic relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="180:208	For instance, it seems reasonable that the object of a noun should receive greater weight in selecting the noun's sense than the verb for which this noun serves as a complement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="181:208	Confusing senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="182:208	In another example, the Hebrew word 'qatann', which two of its meanings are 'small' and 'young', modified the word 'sikkuy', which means 'prospect' or 'chance'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="183:208	In this context, the correct sense is necessarily 'small'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="184:208	However, the relation that was observed in the corpus was 'young prospect', relating to the human sense of 'prospect' which appeared in sport articles (a promising young person)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="185:208	This borrowed sense of 'prospect' is necessarily inappropriate, since in Hebrew it is represented by the equivalent of 'hope' ('tiqva'), and not by 'sikkuy'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="186:208	The reason for this problem is that after producing the possible target alternatives, our model ignores the source language input as it uses only a monolingual target corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="187:208	This can be solved if we use an aligned bilingual corpus, as suggested by Sadler (1989) and Brown et al.(1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="189:208	In such a corpus the occurrences of the relation 'young prospect' will be aligned to the corresponding occurrences of the Hebrew word 'tiqva', and will not be used when the Hebrew word 'sikkuy' is involved." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="190:208	Yet, it should be brought in mind that an aligned corpus is the result of manual translation, which can be viewed as a manual tagging of the words with their equivalent senses in the other language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="191:208	This resource is much more expensive and less available than the untagged monolingual corpus, while it seems to be necessary only for relatively rare situations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="192:208	Lack of deep understanding." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="193:208	By their nature, statistical methods rely on large quantities of shallow information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="194:208	Thus, they are doomed to fail when disambiguation can rely only on deep understanding of the text and no other surface cues are available." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="195:208	This happened in one of the Hebrew examples, where the two alternatives were either 'emigration law' or 'immigration law' (the Hebrew word 'hagira' is used for both subsenses)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="196:208	While the context indicated that the first alternative is correct, the statistics preferred the second alternative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="197:208	It seems that such cases are quiet rare, but only further evaluation will show the extent to which deep understanding is really needed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="198:208	7 Conclusions The method presented takes advantage of two linguistic phenomena: the different usage of words and word senses among different languages and the importance of lexical cooccurrences within syntactic relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="199:208	The experiment shows that these phenomena are indeed useful for practical disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="200:208	We suggest that the high precision received in the experiment relies on two characteristics of the am136 biguity phenomena, namely the sparseness and redundancy of the disambiguating data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="201:208	By sparseness we mean that within the large space of alternative interpretations produced by ambiguous utterances, only a small portion is commonly used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="202:208	Therefore the chance of an inappropriate interpretation to be observed in the corpus (in other contexts) is low." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="203:208	Redundancy relates to the fact that different informants (such as different lexical relations or deep understanding) tend to support rather than contradict one another, and therefore the chance of picking a 'wrong' informant is low." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="204:208	The examination of the failures suggests that future research may improve both the applicability and precision of the model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="205:208	Our next goal is to handle inapplicable cases by using cooccurrence data regardless of syntactic relations and similarities between words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="206:208	We expect that increasing the applicability will lead to some decrease in precision, similar to the tradeoff between recall and precision in information retrieval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="207:208	Pursuing this tradeoff will improve the performance of the method and reveal its limitations." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="15:140	In order to disambiguate 'bank' in a text, we would produce neighborhoods for each sense, and intersect them with the text, our assumption being that the neighborhood which shared more words with the text would determine the correct sense." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:189	1.2 WHY IT'S HARD The initial priorities in this research were:." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:189	Generality (e.g. , minimal assumptions about the text) . Accuracy in identifying SF occurrences  Simplicity of design and speed Efficient use of the available text was not a high priority, since it was felt that plenty of text was available even for an inefficient learner, assuming sufficient speed to make use of it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:189	These priorities 209 had a substantial influence on the approach taken." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:189	They are evaluated in retrospect in Section 4." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:189	The first step in finding a subcategorization frame is finding a verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:189	Because of widespread and productive noun/verb ambiguity, dictionaries are not much use -they do not reliably exclude the possibility oflexical ambiguity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:189	Even if they did, a program that could only learn SFs for unambiguous verbs would be of limited value." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:189	Statistical disambiguators make dictionaries more useful, but they have a fairly high error rate, and degrade in the presence of many unfamiliar words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:189	Further, it is often difficult to understand where the error is coming from or how to correct it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:189	So finding verbs poses a serious challenge for the design of an accurate, general-purpose algorithm for detecting SFs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:189	In fact, finding main verbs is more difficult than it might seem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:189	One problem is distinguishing participles from adjectives and nouns, as shown below." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:189	(2) a. John has \[~p rented furniture\] (comp.: John has often rented apartments) b. John was smashed (drunk) last night (comp.: John was kissed last night) c. John's favorite activity is watching TV (comp.: John's favorite child is watching TV) In each case the main verb is have or be in a context where most parsers (and statistical disambiguators) would mistake it for an auxiliary and mistake the following word for a participial main verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:189	A second challenge to accuracy is determining which verb to associate a given complement with." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:189	Paradoxically, example (1) shows that in general it isn't possible to do this without already knowing the SF." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:189	One obvious strategy would be to wait for sentences where there is only one candidate verb; unfortunately, it is very difficult to know for certain how many verbs occur in a sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:189	Finding some of the verbs in a text reliably is hard enough; finding all of them reliably is well beyond the scope of this work." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:189	Finally, any system applied to real input, no matter how carefully designed, will occasionally make errors in finding the verb and determining its subcategorizatiou frame." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:189	The more times a given verb appears in the corpus, the more likely it is that one of those occurrences will cause an erroneous judgment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:189	For that reason any learning system that gets only positive examples and makes a permanent judgment on a single example will always degrade as the number of occurrences increases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:189	In fact, making a judgment based on any fixed number of examples with any finite error rate will always lead to degradation with corpussize." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:189	A better approach is to require a fixed percentage of the total occurrences of any given verb to appear with a given SF before concluding that random error is not responsible for these observations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:189	Unfortunately, determining the cutoff percentage requires human intervention and sampling error makes classification unstable for verbs with few occurrences in the input." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:189	The sampling error can be dealt with (Brent, 1991) but predetermined cutoff percentages stir require eye-bailing the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:189	Thus robust, unsupervised judgments in the face of error pose the third challenge to developing an accurate learning system." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="53:189	2 VERB DETECTION The technique I developed for finding verbs is based on the Case Filter of Rouvret and Verguaud (1980)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:189	The Case Filter is a proposed rule of grammar which, as it applies to English, says that every noun-phrase must appear either immediately to the left of a tensed verb, immediately to the right of a preposition, or immediately to the right of a main verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:189	Adverbs and adverbial phrases (including days and dates) are ignored for the purposes of case adjacency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:189	A noun-phrase that satisfies the Case Filter is said to 'get case' or 'have case', while one that violates it is said to 'lack case'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:189	The program judges an open-class word to be a main verb if it is adjacent to a pronoun or proper name that would otherwise lack case." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:189	Such a pronoun or proper name is either the subject or 210 the direct object of the verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:189	Other noun phrases are not used because it is too difficult to determine their right boundaries accurately." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:189	The two criteria for evaluating the performance of the main-verb detection technique are efficiency and accuracy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:189	Both were measured using a 2.6 million word corpus for which the Penn Treebank project provides hand-verified tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:189	Efficiency of verb detection was assessed by running the SF detection module in the normal mode, where verbs were detected using the Case Filter technique, and then running it again with the Penn Tags substituted for the verb detection module." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="120:189	Moreover, the results obtained with those methods are quite encouraging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:189	Nonetheless, two obvious barriers still stand on the path to a fully automated SF dictionary: a decision algorithm that can handle random error, and techniques for detecting many more types of SFs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:189	Algorithms are currently being developed to resolve raw SF observations into genuine lexical properties and random error." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="123:189	The idea is to automatically generate statistical models of the sources of error." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="124:189	For example, purpose adjuncts like 'John quit to pursue a career in finance' are quite rare, accounting for only two percent of the apparent infinitival complements." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="125:189	Furthermore, they are distributed across a much larger set of matrix verbs than the true infinitival complements, so any given verb should occur with a purpose adjunct extremely rarely." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="126:189	In a histogram sorting verbs by their apparent frequency of occurrence with infinitival complements, those that in fact have appeared with purpose adjuncts and not true subcategorized infinitives will be clustered at the low frequencies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="127:189	The distributions of such clusters can be modeled automatically and the models used for identifying false positives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="128:189	The second requirement for automatically generating a full-scale dictionary is the ability to detect many more types of SFs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="129:189	SFs involving certain prepositional phrases are particularly chal: lenging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="130:189	For example, while purpose adjuncts (mistaken for infinitival complements) are relatively rare, instrumental adjuncts as in 'John hit the nail with a hammer' are more common." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="131:189	The problem, of course, is how to distinguish them from genuine, subcategorized PPs headed by with, as in 'John sprayed the lawn with distilled water'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="132:189	The hope is that a frequency analysis like the one planned for purpose adjuncts will work here as well, but how successful it will be, and if successful how large a sample size it will require, remain to be seen." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="133:189	The question of sample size leads back to an evaluation of the initial priorities, which favored simplicity, speed, and accuracy, over efficient use of the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="134:189	There are various ways in which the high-priority criteria can be traded off against efficiency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="135:189	For example, consider (2c): one might expect that the overwhelming majority of occurrences of 'is V-ing' are genuine progressives, while a tiny minority are cases copula." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="136:189	One might also expect that the occasional copula constructions are not concentrated around any one present participle but rather distributed randomly among a large population." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="137:189	If those expectations are true then a frequency-modeling mechanism like the one being developed for adjuncts ought to prevent the mistaken copula from doing any harm." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:227	1 Introduction Many psychologists are quite content to declare that intelligence is what you measure by means of an intelligence test." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:227	In a somewhat similar way one could say that lexical knowledge is the kind of knowledge that can be expressed in words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="9:227	A further advantage is that it automatically relates lexical knowledge to something that lends itself to intersubjective inspection: linguistic utterances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:227	And yet another advantage is that it tells us how and where to look for typical expressions of lexical knowledge within the welter of linguistic utterances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:227	In ever widening concentric circles, we can inspect: general dictionaries as sources of the lexical knowledge that is associated with the 'common core' vocabulary; encyclopedias for additional knowledge associated with many of the items contained in the dictionaries and for lexically expressed information about all kinds of facts and events; specialiTed dictionaries for more expert knowledge in specific domains; manuals, treatises, newspaper articles, speeches, broadcasts and so forth for yet more details on anything and everything that humans find worth-while communicating about." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:255	The parser is based on a wide coverage grammar for English, developed by the New York University's Linguistic String Project, and it uses the machine-readable version of the Oxford Advanced lw~arner's Dictionary as a source of its basic vocabulary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:255	The parser operates on stochastically tagged text, and contains a powerful skip-and-fit recovery mechanism that allows it to deal with extra-grammatical input and to operate effectively under a severe time pressure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:255	Empirical experiments, testing parser's speed and accuracy, were performed on several collections: a collection of technical abstracts (CACM-3204), a corpus of news messages (MUC-3), a selection from ACM Computer Library database, and a collection of Wall Street Journal articles, approximately 50 million words in total." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:255	INTRODUCTION Recently, there has been a growing demand for fast and reliable natural language processing tools, capable of performing reasonably accurate syntactic analysis of large volumes of text within an acceptable time." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:255	A full sentential parser that produces complete mmlysis of input, may be considered reasonably fast if the average parsing time per sentence falls anywhere between 2 and 10 seconds." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:255	A large volume of text, perhaps a gigabyte or more, would contain as many as 7 million sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:255	At the speed of say, 6 sec/sentence, this much text would require well over a year to parse." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:255	While 7 million sentences is a lot of text, this much may easily he contained in a fair-sized text database." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:255	Therefore, the parsing speed would have to be increased by at least a factor of 10 to make such a task manageable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:255	In this paper we describe a fast and robust natural language parser that can analyze written text and generate regularized parse structures at a speed of below 1 second per sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:255	In the experiments conducted on variety of natural langauge texts, including technical prose, news messages, and newspaper articles, the average parsing time varied between 0.4 sec/sentence and 0.7 see/sentence, or between 1600 and 2600 words per minute, as we tried to find an acceptable compromise between parser's speed and precision.l It has long been assumed that in order to gain speed, one may have to trade in some of the purser's accuracy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:255	For example, we may have to settle for partial parsing that would recognize only selected grammatical structures (e.g. noun phrases; Ruge et al. , 1991), or would avoid making difficult decisions (e.g. pp-attachment; Hindle, 1983)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:255	Much of the overhead and inefficiency comes from the fact that the lexical and structural ambiguity of natmal language input can only be dealt with using limited context information available to the parser." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:255	Partial parsing techniques have been used with a considerable success in processing large volumes of text, for example AT&T's Fidditch (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) parsed 13 million words of Associated Press news messages, while MIT's parser (de Marcken, 1990) was used to process the 1 million word Lancaster/Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:255	In both cases, the parsers were designed to do partial processing only, that is, they would never attempt a complete analysis of certain constructions, such as the attachment of pp-adjuncts, subordinate clauses, or coordinations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:255	This kind of partial analysis may be sufficient in some applications because of a relatively high precision of identifying correct syntactic dependencies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:255	2 However, the ratio at which these dependencies are identified (that is, the recall level) isn't sufficiently high due to the inherently partial character of the parsing process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:255	The low recall means that many of the important dependencies are lost in parsing, and t These results were obtained on a 21 MIPS SparcStafion ELC." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:140	OVERALL DESIGN Our information retrieval system consists of a traditional statistical backbone (Harman and Candela, 1989) augmented with various natural language processing components that assist the system in database processing (stemming, indexing, word and phrase clustering, selectional restrictions), and translate a user's information request into an effective query." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="62:480	The verb agree can mean either 'concur,' 'benefit,' or 'be equivalent' and, in general, adding the affix -ment to a verb creates a noun corresponding either to an act, or to its result, its object, or its associated state." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="69:480	For example, although normally the collocation wait on means 'serve' (Mary waited on John), the failure of a role-related expectation, such as that the BENEFICIARY be animate, can override this preference (Mary waited on the steps)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:480	Thus, collocations and word associations are strong sources of information that an understander must weigh against other cues, and not just treat as rules for sense-filtering (as in Hirst 1987 or Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler 1989)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:480	The selection of a role relationship can both influence and be influenced by the selection of word senses, because preferences partially constrain the various combinations of a role, its holder, and the filler." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:57	But, with robust syntactic parsers that are becoming more frequently available, syntactically recognizable phenomena about word usage can be confidently noted in large collections of texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:57	We present here a new system called SEXTANT which uses these parsers and the finer-grained contexts they produce to judge word similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:57	BACKGROUND Many machine-based approaches to term similarity, such as found in TItUMP (Jacobs and Zernick 1988) and FERRET (Mauldin 1991), can be characterized as knowledge-rich in that they presuppose that known lexical items possess Conceptual Dependence(CD)like descriptions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:57	Such an approach necessitates a great amount of manual encoding of semantic information and suffers from the drawbacks of cost (in terms of initial coding, coherence checking, maintenance after modifications, and costs derivable from a host of other software engineering concern); of domain dependence (a semantic structure developed for one domain would not be applicable to another." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:57	For example, sugar would have very different semantic relations in a medical domain than in a commodities exchange domain); and of rigidity (even within wellestablished domain, new subdomains spring up, e.g. AIDS." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="9:57	researchers have consistently considered that 324 'the linguistic apparatus required for effective domain-independent analysis is not yet at hand,' and have concentrated on counting document co-occurrence statistics (Peat and Willet 1991), based on the idea that words appearing in the same document must share some semantic similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:57	But document cooccurrence suffers from two problems: granulaxity (every word in the document is considered potentially related to every other word, no matter what the distance between them) and co-occurrence (for two words to be seen as similar they must physically appear in the same document." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="15:57	Researchers such as (Evans et al. 1991) and (Church and Hanks 1990) have applied robust grammars and statistical techniques over large corpora to extract interesting noun phrases and subject-verb, verb-object pairs." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="47:57	One of the interesting aspects of this approach, contrary to the coarse-grained document co-occurrence approach, is that administration and injection need never appear in the same document for them to be recognized as semantically similar." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:57	When the same procedure is run over a corpus of library science abstracts, administration is recognized as closest to administration graduate, office, campus, education, director,  Similarly circulation was found to be closest to flow in the medical corpus and to date in the library corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="26:423	Our research, however, differs in two respects: first, we employ a more expressive lexical semantics; second, our focus is on all major categories in the language, and not just verbs." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="34:423	The general framework assumes four basic levels of semantic description: argument structure, qualia structure, lexical inheritance structure, and event structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:423	Connecting these different levels is a set of generative devices that provide for the compositional interpretation of words in context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:423	The most important of these devices is a semantic transformation called type coercion--analogous to coercion in programming languages--which captures the semantic relatedness between syntactically distinct expressions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:423	As an operation on types within a A-calculus, type coercion can be seen as transforming a monomorphic language into one with polymorphic types (cf.Cardelli and Wegner 1985)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="41:423	Briefly, however, whenever there exists a grammatical environment where more than one syntactic type satisfies the semantic type selected by the governing element, the governing element can be analyzed as coercing a range of surface types into a single semantic type." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="45:423	332 James Pustejovsky et al. Lexical Semantic Techniques for Corpus Analysis One component of this approach, the qualia structure, specifies the different aspects of a word's meaning through the use of subtyping." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="58:423	The qualia structure, thus, can be viewed as a kind of generic template for structuring this knowledge." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:423	Such information about how nouns relate to other lexical items and their concepts might prove to be much more useful in full-text information retrieval than what has come from standard statistical techniques." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:423	To illustrate how such semantic structuring might be useful, consider the general class of artifact nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:423	A generative view of the lexicon predicts that by classifying an element into a particular category, we can generate many aspects of its semantic structure, and hence, its syntactic behavior." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:423	For example, the representation above for book refers to several word senses, all of which are logically related by the semantic template for an artifactual object." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:423	That is, it contains information, it has a material extension, it serves some function, and it is created by some particular act or event." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:423	2 Briefly, the qualia can be defined as follows:  CONSTITUTIVE: the relation between an object and its constituent parts;  FORMAL: that which distinguishes it within a larger domain;  TELIC: its purpose and function;  AGENTIVE: factors involved in its origin or 'bringing it about'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:423	In the qualia structures given below, we adopt the convention that \[c~, r\] denotes conjunction of formulas within the feature structure, while \[a; r\] will denote disjunction." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="67:423	333 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Such an analysis allows us to minimally structure objects according to these four qualia." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:423	As an example of how objects cluster according to these dimensions, we will briefly consider three object types: (1) containers (of information), e.g., book, tape, record; (2) instruments, e.g., gun, hammer, paintbrush; and (3) figure-ground objects, e.g., door, room, fireplace." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:423	Because of how their qualia structures differ, these classes appear in vastly different grammatical contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:423	As with containers in general, information containers permit metonymic extensions between the container and the material contained within it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:423	Collocations such as those in Examples 4 through 7 indicate that this metonymy is grammaticalized through specific and systematic head-PP constructions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:423	Example 4 read a book Example 5 read a story in a book Example 6 read a tape Example 7 read the information on the tape Instruments, on the other hand, display classic agent-instrument causative alternations, such as those in Examples 8 through 11 (cf.Fillmore 1968; Lakoff 1968, 1970)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="76:423	Finally, figure-ground nominals (Pustejovsky and Anick 1988) permit perspective shifts such as those in Examples 12 through 15." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:423	These are nouns that refer to physical objects as well as the specific enclosure or aperture associated with it." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="81:423	Example 15 The smoke filled the fireplace." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:423	That is, paint and scrub are actions on physical objects while walk through and fill are processes in spaces." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:423	These collocational patterns, we argue, are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of the noun, and we term such sets of collocated structures lexical conceptual paradigms (LCPs)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:423	4 To make this point clearer, let us consider a specific example of an LCP from the computer science domain, namely for the noun tape." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:423	Because of the particular metonymy observed for a noun like tape, we will classify it as belonging to the container/containee LCP." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:423	This general class is represented as follows, where P and 0 are predicate variables: 5 container(x,y) \] CONST = P(y) FORMAL = Q(x) TELIC = hold(S,x,y) The LCP is a generic qualia structure that captures not only the semantic relationship between arguments types of a relation, but also, through corpus-tuning, the collocation relations that realize these roles." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:423	The telic function of a container, for example, is the relation hold, but this underspecifies which spatial prepositions would adequately satisfy this semantic relation (e.g. in, on, inside, etc.)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:423	In this view, a noun such as tape would have the following qualia structure: tape(x,y) CONST = information(y) FORMAL = physobj(x),2-dimen(x) TELIC = contain(S,x,y) AGENTIVE = write(T,z,y) This states that a tape is an 'information container' that is also a two-dimensional physical object, where the information is written onto the object." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:423	6 With such nouns, a logical metonymy exists (as the result of type coercion), when the logical argument of a semantic type, which is selected by a function of some sort, denotes the semantic type itself." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:423	Thus, in this example, the type selected for by a verb such as read refers to the 'information' argument for tape, while a verb such as carry would select for the 'physical object' argument." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:423	They are, however, logically related, since the noun itself denotes a relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:423	The representation above simply states that any semantics for tape must logically make reference to the object itself (formal), what it can contain (const), what purpose 4 This relates to Mel'~uk's lexical functions and the syntactic structures they associate with an element." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:423	See Mel'~uk (1988) and references therein." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:423	Cruse (1986, 1992) and Nunberg (1978) discuss the foregrounding and backgrounding of information with respect to similar examples." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:423	5 Within the qualia structure for a term, FORMAL and CONST roles typically refer to the object domain while TELI and ACENTIVE refer to events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:423	Hence, the first parameter in the latter two roles refers to an event sort, i.e., a state (s), process (p), or transition (T)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:423	6 The appropriate selection of a surface spatial preposition will follow from its formal type specification as a 2-dimen object." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="99:423	Pustejovsky (in press) for details." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:423	335 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 it serves (telic), and how it arises (agentive)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:423	This provides us with a semantic representation that can capture the multiple perspectives a single lexical item may assume in different contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:423	Yet, the qualia for a lexical item such as tape are not isolated values for that one word, but are integrated into a global knowledge base indicating how these senses relate to other lexical items and their senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:423	This is the contribution of inheritance and the hierarchical structuring of knowledge (cf.Evans and Gazdar 1990; Copestake and Briscoe 1992; Russell et al. 1992)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:423	In Pustejovsky (1991) it is suggested that there are two types of relational structures for lexical knowledge; a fixed inheritance similar to that of an is-a hierarchy (cf.Touretzky 1986); and a dynamic structure that operates generatively from the qualia structure of a lexical item to create a relational structure for ad hoc categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:423	7 Reviewing briefly, the basic idea is that semantics allows for the dynamic creation of arbitrary concepts through the application of certain transformations to lexical meanings." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:423	Thus for every predicate, Q, we can generate its opposition, =Q. Similarly, these two predicates can be related temporally to generate the transition events defining this opposition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:423	These operations include but may not be limited to: -~, negation; _<, temporal precedence; >, temporal succession; =, temporal equivalence; and act, an operator adding agency to an argument." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:423	We will call the concept space generated by these operations the Projective Conclusion Space of a specific quale for a lexical item." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:423	To return to the example of tape above, the predicates read and copy are related to the telic value by just such an operation, while predicates such as mount and dismount--i.e, unmount--are related to the formal role." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:423	Following the previous discussion, with mounted as the predicate Q, successive applications of the negation and temporal precedence operators derives the transition verbs mount and dismount." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:423	8 We return to a discussion of this in Section 3, and to how this space relates to statistically significant collocations in text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="114:423	It is our view that the approach outlined above for representing lexical knowledge can be put to use in the service of information retrieval tasks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="115:423	In this respect, our proposal can be compared to attempts at object classification in information science." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="116:423	One approach, known as faceted classification (Vickery 1975) proceeds roughly as follows: collect all terms lying within a field; then group the terms into facets by assigning them to categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="117:423	Typical examples of this are state, property, reaction, and device." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="118:423	However, each subject area is likely to have its own sets of categories, which makes it difficult to re-use a set of facet classifications." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="119:423	9 Even if the relational information provided by the qualia structure and inheritance would improve performance in information retrieval tasks, one problem still remains, namely that it would be very time-consuming to hand-code such structures for all nouns in a domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="120:423	Since it is our belief that such representations are generic structures across all domains, it is our long-term goal to develop methods for automatically extracting these relations and values from on-line corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:423	In the sections that follow, we describe several experiments indicating that the qualia structures do, in fact, correlate with well-behaved collocational patterns, thereby allowing us to perform structure-matching operations over corpora to find these relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:423	7 This is similar to thesauruslike structures, within the IR community, cf.for example Sparck Jones (1981)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="124:423	8 Details of the derivation are as follows." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="125:423	Let Q be mounted, then ~Q gives ~mounted, and K applied to these two states gives Q < -~Q, which is lexicalized as dismount." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:126	Introduction One of the main problems for applied natural language processing is gaps in the lexicon, including missing words and word senses, and inadequate descriptions of word use in context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:126	Traditional lexicography has similar concerns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:126	The availability of large, on-line text corpora provides a straightforward tool for enlarging the stock of words included in a lexicon." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:126	The identification of additional word senses and uses is more problematic, however." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:126	Much recent lexicographic work employs concordances generated from text corpora for these purposes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:126	While this approach provides a more solid empirical basis than traditional lexicographic approaches (which depend on the manual collection and sorting of citation index cards), concordances can actually provide too much data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:126	For example, a concordance for the word certain produced on an 11.6 million-word subsample of the Longman/Lancaster Corpus generated 3,424 entries; a concordance for the word right from the same subcorpus generated 7,619 entries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:126	Simply determining the number of different senses in a database of this size is a daunting task; to accurately group different uses or rank them in order of importance is not really feasible without the use of additional tools." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:126	One such tool is to simply sort concordance lines according to their different collocational patterns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:126	Entries can be sorted according to their collocates on both the left and the right." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:126	Many of these collocational pairs show a strong relation to a particular word sense (e.g. , contrast right ear and right away), and thus analysis of collocational relations has become an important tool for lexical knowledge acquisition (see Sinclair 1991; Smadja 1991; Zernik 1991)." ></td>
	<td class="line o" title="13:126	In addition, there are statistical tools that can help determine the relative strength of collocational relations." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="14:126	For example, Church and Hanks (1990) describe the use of the mutual information index for this purpose (cf.Calzolari and Bindi 1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:126	Church et al.(1991) further describe the use of t-scores to assess the extent of the differences between the collocational patterns of nearly synonymous words." ></td>
	<td class="line pc" title="18:126	These tools are important in that the strongest collocational associations often represent different word senses, and thus 'they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needs to be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags' (Church and Hanks 1990, p. 28)." ></td>
	<td class="line n" title="19:126	However, such tools do not directly characterize word senses or even provide any direct indication of the number of different senses that a word has." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="24:126	In particular, this technique contributes three types of information not provided by other complementary techniques: 1) an indication of the number of major senses and/or uses associated with a word; 2) an indication of the way that various collocational patterns relate to one another in marking word senses and uses; and 3) a fuller analysis of the senses themselves, based on interpretation of the shared bases underlying the groupings of collocations." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="28:126	In particular, that study illustrates the use of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to identify the relations among semantically related word types (e.g. , piccolo, corto, breve) and their collocates (or 'word mates')." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:126	The input data for this approach are mutual information indexes computed over the domain of an entire corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:126	Separate association indexes are computed for each pair of target word types (e.g. , piccolo and corto) and for all of the word types in relation to various 'word-mates' (e.g. , piccolo with bambino)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:126	This entire matrix is then analyzed by MDS to cluster word types and word-mates along a few underlying dimensions, providing a geometric representation of the semantic domain in question (in this case, 'smallness')." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="33:126	The geometric distance between a word-mate and its word type reflects the strength of the relevant association index, and word-mates are clustered together to the extent that they are associated with the same word types (see Bindi et al. 1991)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:126	Factor analysis differs from MDS in that the input data are computed over the domain of individual texts, rather than over the domain of the entire corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:126	Further, the application of factor analysis here is to identify basic word senses and uses associated with a single word rather than the relations among a set of semantically related words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="37:126	If we assume that texts are topically coherent, it follows that groupings of collocations that co-occur frequently in texts will often reflect different underlying word senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:126	This approach is illustrated here through analyses of two words--certain and right--in an 11.66 million-word subsample of the Longman/Lancaster corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:126	This corpus is designed to represent a wide range of text varieties (see Summers 1991), including ten major topical categories (e.g. , natural science, social science, fiction), three mediums (books, periodicals, and ephemera), and three levels (technical/literary, lay/middle, and popular)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:126	The first step in the analysis is to identify the major collocational patterns for the target word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:126	In the present analysis, this was done simply by computing the frequency of all collocational pairs over the entire corpus; collocations that occurred more than 30 times were considered to be important word associations and thus included in the subsequent analyses." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="11:178	Statistical data about these various cooccurrence relations is employed for a variety of applications, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), language generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), machine translation (Brown et al. , ; Sadler, 1989), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989) and various disambiguation tasks (Dagan et al. , 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Grishman et al. , 1986; Dagan and Itai, 1990)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="13:178	Due to data sparseness in unrestricted language, the aggregate probability of such cooccurrences is large and can easily get to 25% or more, even for a very large training corpus (Church and Mercer, 1992)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="12:130	If we assume that word-associations determine language production, then it should be possible to estimate the strength of an associative relation between two words on the basis of the relative frequencies that these words co-occur in texts." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:130	This paper describes such a comparison and shows that corpus-based computations of word associations are similar to association norms collected from human subjects." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:130	According to the law of association by contiguity, the association strength between two words should be a function of the relative frequency of the two words being perceived together, i.e. the relative frequency of the two words occuring together." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="30:230	1.2 Word Sense Collocation Functions Until recently, the choice of the various functions used in rule-based systems was made mainly according to anecdotal information about the effectiveness of, for example, various attachment preference strategies." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="32:230	Lexical collocation functions, especially those determined statistically, have recently attracted considerable attention in computational linguistics (Calzolari and Bindi 1990; Church and Hanks 1990; Sekine et al. 1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993) mainly, though not exclusively, for use in disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:230	These functions are typically derived by observing the occurrences of tuples (usually pairs or triples) that summarize relations present in an analysis of a text, or their surface occurrences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:230	For example, Hindle and Rooth (1993) and Resnik and Hearst (1993) give experimental results on the effectiveness of functions based on lexical associations, or lexical-class associations, at selecting appropriate prepositional phrase attachments." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:230	The results we present show that these functions vary considerably in disambiguation accuracy, but that the best collocation functions are more effective than a function based on simple estimates of syntactic rule probabilities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:230	In particular, the best collocation function performs significantly better than a related function that defines collocation strength in terms of mutual information, reducing the error rate in a disambiguation task from approximately 30% to approximately 10%." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="40:230	Finally, we take a close look at a set of semantic collocation functions, defining them in Section 5 and comparing their effectiveness at disambiguation in Section 6." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:230	2. The Experimental Setup Disambiguation Task All the experiments we describe here were done with the Core Language Engine (CLE), a primarily rule-based natural language-processing system (Alshawi 1992)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:230	More specifically, the work on optimizing preference factors and semantic collocations was done as part of a project on spoken language translation in which the CLE was used for analysis and generation of both English and Swedish (AgnSs et al. 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:230	636 Hiyan Alshawi and David Carter Training and Scaling Preference Functions The work presented here is all concerned with the English analysis side, though we see no reason why its conclusions should not be applicable to Swedish or other natural languages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:230	In our experiments we made use of the Air T, avel Information System (ATIS) corpus of transcribed speech sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:230	This application was chosen because the proposed method for automatic derivation of scaling factors requires a corpus of sentences that are representative of the sublanguage, together with some independent measure of the correctness or plausibility of analyses of these sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:230	In addition, we had access to a hand-parsed subcollection of the ATIS corpus built as part of the Penn Treebank project (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:230	Another reason for choosing ATIS was that it consists of several thousand sentences in a constrained discourse domain, which helped avoid sparseness problems in training collocation functions} In the various experiments, the alternatives we are choosing between are analyses expressed in the version of quasi logical form (QLF) described by Alshawi and Crouch (1992)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="219:230	The experimental results presented indicate that, by using a fairly crude training score measure (comparing only phrase structure trees) with a few thousand training sentences, the method can yield a set of scaling factors that are significantly better than those derived by a labor-intensive hand-tuning effort." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="220:230	We have also confirmed empirically that considerable differences exist between the effectiveness of differently formulated collocation functions for disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="221:230	The experiments provide a basis for selecting among different collocational functions and suggest that a collocation function must be evaluated in the context of other functions, rather than on its own, if the correct selection is to be made." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="224:230	The method for computing scaling factors described here has more recently been applied to optimizing preference selection for the task of choosing between analyses arising from different word hypotheses in a speech recognition system (Rayner et al. 1994) and is applicable to other problems, such as choosing between possible target representations in a machine translation system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="225:230	Finally, it would be interesting to combine the work on semantic collocation functions with that on similarity-based clustering (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993), with the aim of overcoming the problem of sparse training data." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="54:189	2.2 Focused Sample and Base Sample For our experiments of automatic term suggestion, we selected a predefined topic called 'European Politics and Business'." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="69:189	The terms suggested are split into three categones: single word terms, two-word terms and multi-word terms (or phrases)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:189	The following three sections descnbe in detail the methods for generating each of the three categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:189	2.4 Suggesting Single Word Terms Automatically suggesting single word terms as being topically oriented has been most challenging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:189	Our experiments indicated that the ffirst order' statistics, probability and entropy alone, are not sufficient for gathering information about the topicality of a word in running text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:189	The information in both measurements is essentially equivalent since entropy is just the log inverse of probability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:189	We found that the 'second-order' statistics, such as vadance or standard deviation of term frequencies across documents, provide greater insight into topicality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:189	We selected the interval between the occurrences of a word as the basis for analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:189	Our intuitions led us to believe that topical single words should appear more frequently and more regularly, i.e. at approximately even intervals, in the focused sample than in the base sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:189	The focused sample represents, more or less, a topical sublanguage set while the base sample a general language set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:189	Unlike probability and entropy statistics which yield average scores for the whole document, the use of interval makes it possible to get an 'instantaneous' measure at any location in the document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:189	More specifically, an interval can be measured 'instantaneously' at any point in the text between the occurrences of a particular word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:189	Though using interval alone might still not be sufficient for identifying word topicality, it allowed us to measure the vadance which would help identify words that were always changing in their rate of occurrences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:189	Thus, three scores were generated for each word: the mean log interval, the standard deviation of the mean log interval, and the normalized standard deviation of the mean log interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:189	The use of a log scale for these measurements is to minimize the effect of unduly large variations in words with long mean intervals." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:189	The normalized standard deviation is produced by simply dividing the raw standard deviation by the mean log interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:189	In most cases, raw standard deviation is found to be larger for words having long mean intervals." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:189	In order to compare the standard deviations across words of different intervals, we found this normalization process quite useful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:189	134 i After scores were generated for all the words in both the focused sample and the base sample, score comparisons between the two samples were carried out in two ways: comparing the intervals and comparing the standard deviations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:189	To compare the intervals, the =base' mean log interval was subtracted from the 'focused' mean log Interval and divided by the raw standard deviation from the base sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:189	The result represents the change of mean log intervals." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:189	More explicitly, it yields the number of standard deviations that the 'focused' mean log interval is different from the =base' mean log interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:189	The more negative;the value, the more significant the change, and the more prominent the word would appear in the focused sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:189	To compare the standard deviations, the normalized =base' standard deviation was subtracted from the normalized 'focused' standard deviation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:189	The difference symbolizes how the word is distributed in ~e focused sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:189	The more negative the value is, the more 'bursty' the word is distributed, and the more likely it is content oriented since 'content words tend to appear in 'bursts' (Church and Mercer 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:189	If a single word term is found in both data samples and it receives negative scores from both interval and standard deviation comparisons, it would be included in the suggested list as being topical onented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:189	2.5 Suggesting Two-Word Terms The method for suggesting two-word terms tumed out to be much simpler than that for single word terms though the same techniques are equally applicable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:189	Here, the traditional mutual information score was used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:189	As stated in Church, et al.(1991) and elsewhere, the mutual information measurement can be expressed as:." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:189	(:p(WlW2)) l(WlW2) = lg~,p(wl)p(w2) where p(wlw2) is the frequency in the data collection of the two-word compound (wl,w2); and p(wl) and p(w2) the frequency of the word constituents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:189	The highest mutual information score indicates that the individual probabilities are low while the two words occur together frequently." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:189	Two steps led to our automatic suggestion of topic-oriented two-word terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:189	First, the mutual information score was computed for each pair of words that occur in each of the two samples." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:189	To capture topicality, we were only interested in pairs of words with high mutual information scores." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:189	Therefore, any pair which contained =closed class' words, such as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, or single letters, digit numbers, or overly common verbs like 'give', 'take', etc. , were excluded." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:189	Such an exclusion not only helped getting pairs of words with high mutual information scores, but also sped up computation significantly." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:189	A threshold value was also set such that if any two-word unit occurred less than 3 times in the sample or received a mutual information score lower than 6.0, it was eliminated and would not participate in the next comparison measurement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:189	135 With the mutual information scores in hand, a 'delta' score was generated by subtracting the 'base' mutual information score from the ffocused' mutual information score." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:189	Topically, prominent two-word terms normally have lower scores in the focused sample that is 'keyed' to their topic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:189	This is because the constituent words distribute in wider range of contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:189	The probability of them occurring separately increases relative to the probability of them occurring together (Steier and Belew 1994)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:189	Therefore, the more negative the 'delta' score, the more topically sensitive the two-word term is. If a two-word term occurs in both data samples and receives a negative 'delta' score, it would be included in the suggested list as being topically onented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:189	2.6 Suggesting Multi-Word Terms When automatically suggesting content two-word terms, we looked at the mutual information scores for adjacent words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:189	For multi-word terms, the mutual information score was calculated for non-adjacent words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="114:189	Our intuitions led us to believe that if there is a significant statistical linkage, i.e. a high mutual information score, between such a pair of words, it is highly possible that they belong to a larger linguistic component." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="115:189	Our first step was to compute mutual information scores for a word unit separated by a distance of two (i.e. having one unspecified word separating them)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="116:189	Two cdteda apply when selecting 'interesting' word units." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="117:189	Their mutual information score must be 10 or greater." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="118:189	Following the observations by Steier and Belew (Steier and Belew1994), we only selected pairs which received lower mutual information score in the focused sample than in the base sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="119:189	Once an 'interesting' word unit of distance two was selected, a concordance was built of all sentences containing that word unit." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="120:189	These sentences were compared for matching text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:189	If a stdng of text was found to include that word unit and, at the same time, occur most frequently in the concordance, its leading and trailing 'closed-set' words (if any) were chopped off." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:189	The remaining text stdng was presented as a suggested multi-word term." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="124:189	RESULTS and DISCUSSION 3.1 Suggested Single Terms The focused sample drawn from the 1988 UPI data contains 12,065 unique words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="9:184	Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel word senses using a combination of online sources, in particular, Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978), Levin's verb classification scheme (Levin, 1993), and WordNet (Miller, 1985)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:184	We have used these techniques to build a database of 10,000 English verb entries containing semantic information that we are currently porting into languages such as Arabic, Spanish, and Korean for multilingual NLP tasks such as foreign language tutoring and machine translation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:184	322 2 Automatic Lexical Acquisition for NLP Tasks As machine-readable resources (i.e. , online dictionaries, thesauri, and other knowledge sources) become readily available to NLP researchers, automated acquisition has become increasingly more attractive." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:184	Several researchers have noted that the average time needed to construct a lexical entry can be as much as 30 minutes (see, e.g., (Neff and McCord, 1990; Copestakc et al. , 1995; Walker and Amsler, 1986))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:184	Given that we are aiming for large-scale lexicons of 20-60,000 words, automation of the acquisition process has become a necessity." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="14:184	Previous research in automatic acquisition focuscs primarily on the use of statistical techniques, such as bilingual alignment (Church and Hanks, 1990; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1996; Wu and Xia, 1995), or extraction of syntactic constructions from online dictionaries and corpora (Brant, 1993; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:184	Others who have taken a more knowledge-based (interlingual) approach (Lonsdale, Mitamura, and Nyberg, 1996) do not provide a means for systematically deriving the relation between surface syntactic structures and their underlying semantic representations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:184	Those who have taken more argument structures into account, e.g., (Copestake et al. , 1995), do not take full advantage of the systematic relation between syntax and semantics during lexical acquisition." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="20:184	The work of Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) is more closely related to our approach in that it attempts to recover a syntacticsemantic relation from machine-readable dictionaries." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="22:184	Others have also argued that the task of simplifyin K lexical entries on the basis of broad semantic class membership is complex and, perhaps, infeasible (see, e.g., Boguraev and llriscoe (1989))." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:316	The same clustering technique is then applied to the classification of multiword compounds." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:316	In order to avoid the explosion of the number of compounds to be handled, compounds in a small subclass are bundled and treated as a single compound." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:316	Another merit of this approach is that we can avoid the data sparseness problem which is ubiquitous in corpus statistics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:316	The quality of one of the obtained compound classes is examined and compared to a conventional approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:316	1 Introduction One of the fundamental issues concerning corpus-based NLP is that we can never expect to know from the training data all the necessary quantitative information for the words that might occur in the test data if the vocabulary is large enough to cope with a real world domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:316	In view of the effectiveness of class-based n-gram language models against the data sparseness problem (Kneser and Ney 1993, Ueberla 1995), it is expected that classes of words are also useful for NLP tasks in such a way that statistics on classes are used whenever statistics on individual words are unavailable or unreliable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:316	An ideal type of clusters for NLP is the one which guarantees mutual substitutability, in terms of both syntactic and semantic soundness, among words in the same class (Harris 1951, Brill and Marcus 1992)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:316	Take, for example, the following sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:316	(a) He went to the house by car." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="17:316	(d) He went to the house by the sea." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:316	Suppose that we want to parse sentences using a statistical parser and that sentences (a) and (b) appeared in the training and test data, respectively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:316	Since (a) is in the training data, we know that the prepositional phrase by car is attached to the main verb went, not to the noun phrase the house." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:316	Sentence (b) is quite similar to (a) in meaning, and identical to (a) in sentence structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:316	Now if the words apartment and bus are unknown to the parsing system *A part of this work is done when the author was at ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:316	28 (i.e. never occurred in the training data), then sentence (b) must look to the system very much like (c), and it will be very hard for the parsing system to tell the difference in sentence structure between (c) and (d)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:316	However, if the system has access to a predefined set of classes of words, and if car and bus are in the same class, and house and apartme.nt are in another class, it will not be hard for the system to detect the similarity between (a) and (b) and assign the correct sentence structure to (b) without confusing it with (d)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:316	The same argument holds for an example-based machine translation system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:316	In that case, an appropriate translation of (b) is expected to be derived with an example translation of (a) if the system has an access to the classes of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:316	Therefore, it is desirable that we build clustering of the vocabulary in terms of mutual substitutability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:316	Furthermore, clustering is much more useful if the clusters are of variable granularity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:316	Suppose, for example, that we have two sets of clusters, one is finer than the other, and that word-1 and word-2 are in different finer classes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:316	With finer clusters alone, the amount of information on the association of the two words that the system can obtain from the clusters is minimal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:316	However, if the system has a capability of falling back and checking if they belong to the same coarser class, and if that is the case, then the system can take advantage of the class information for the two words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:316	When we extend this notion of two-level word clustering to many levels, we will have a tree representation of all the words in the vocabulary in which the root node represents the whole vocabulary and a leaf node represents a word in the vocabulary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:316	Also, any set of nodes in the tree constitutes a partition (or clustering) of the vocabulary if there exists one and only one node in the set along the path from the root node to each leaf node." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="35:316	In the above examples we looked only at the mutual substitutability of words; however, a lot of information can also be gained if we look at the substitutability of word compounds for either other word compounds or single words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:316	We will introduce the notion of compound-classes, propose a method for constructing them, and present results of our approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:316	2 Hierarchical Clustering of Words Several algorithms have been proposed for automatically clustering words based on a large corpus (Jardino and Adda 91, Brown et al. 1992, Kneser and Ney 1993, Martin et al. 1995, Ueberla 1995)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="41:316	Both types are driven by some objective function, in most cases by perplexity or average mutual information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:316	The merit of the second type for the purpose of constructing hierarchical clustering is that we can easily convert the history of the merging process to a tree-structured representation of the vocabulary." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="44:316	The first type is more robust to the local minimum problem, but the quality of classes greatly depends on the initial set of classes, and finding an initial set of good quality is itself a very difficult problem." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="12:168	This is the reason for many researchers having focused on the massive acquisition of lexical knowledge and semantic information from pre-existing structured lexical resources as automatically as possible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:168	*This research has been partially funded by CICYT TIC96-1243-C03-02 (ITEM project) and the European Comission LE-4003 (EuroWordNet project)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:168	As dictionaries are special texts whose subject matter is a language (or a pair of languages in the case of bilingual dictionaries) they provide a wide range of information about words by giving definitions of senses of words, and, doing that, supplying knowledge not just about language, but about the world itself." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:168	One of the most important relation to be extracted from machine-readable dictionaries (MRD) is the hyponym/hypernym relation among dictionary senses (e.g.(Amsler, 1981), (Vossen and Serail, 1990) ) not only because of its own importance as the backbone of taxonomies, but also because this relation acts as the support of main inheritance mechanisms helping, thus, the acquisition of other relations and semantic features (Cohen and Loiselle, 1988), providing formal structure and avoiding redundancy in the lexicon (Briscoe et al. , 1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:168	For instance, following the natural chain of dictionary senses described in the Diccionario General Ilustrado de la Lengua Espadola (DGILE, 1987) we can discover that a bonsai is a cultivated plant or bush." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:166	There are two reasons for this that I will discuss briefly here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:166	First, the problem of multiple reference." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:166	The head of the NP (book) has a number of systematically related senses that are being expressed simultaneously." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:166	The meaning of book in this sentence cannot be disambiguated between the number of interpretations that are implied: the informational content of the book (military technicalities), its physical appearance (heavily weighted) and the events that are involved in its construction and use (long)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:166	The example illustrates the fact that disambiguation between related senses is not always possible, which leads to the further question if a discrete distinction between such senses is desirable at all." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:166	A number of researchers have answered this question negatively (see eg: (Pustejovsky, 1995) (Killgariff, 1992))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:166	Consider these examples from BROWN: (1) fast run-up (of the stock) (2) fast action (by the city government) (3) fast footwork (by Washington) (4) fast weight gaining (5) fast condition (of the track) (6) fast response time (7) fast people (8) fast ball Each use of the adjective 'fast' in these examples has a slightly different interpretation that could be captured in a number of senses, reflecting the different syntactic and semantic patterns." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="20:166	It seems therefore useful to underspecify the lexical meaning of 'fast' to a representation that captures this primary semantic aspect and gives a general structure for its combination with other lexical items, both locally (in compositional semantics) and globally (in discourse structure)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:166	Both the multiple reference and the sense enumeration problem show that lexical items mostly have an indefinite number of related but highly discourse dependent interpretations, between which cannot be distinguished by semantic tagging alone." ></td>

	<td class="line o" title="8:16	The proposed approach As stated before, the method of Church and Hanks identifies pmrs of lexlcally related words So, for instance, the pair \[conselho seguranfa\] (security conned), with an assocmted mutual mforn~uon of 5.3, can be considered as a potential mdexang term, while the pan' \[para a\] (to the), though 63 tunes roere frequent ro our corpus, having a mutual roformauon of 0.7, can be excluded We have then a erttenon for exclusion, that dispenses with the need for stop hsts, and that alms at assunng the exlstence of a leracal relation between the words of the rematrong pairs But not all pans of lexlcally related words are good rodexmg terms of a document The pair should also meet the reqmrement of being relevant m the considered document The method of Maarek proposes a measure of the resolvrog power of each pair ro the concerned document, thus enabling the selection, among all the poten.al indexing terms, of those that are relevant m each document For rostanco, \[estados umdos\] (united states) has a hxgh mutual roformatmn (8 1) but it can be of little relevance m an article about the hberatton of prisoners by the Serbs of Sarajevo (p=0007) The experiments earned out point to a threshold of the resolwng power around 0 01 We consider as relevant ro a document only the pairs vath a resolvrog power above this threshold When the same pmr occurs ro chfferent paragraphs of the same document, hnks can be estabhshed between those paragraphs At flus point, we only consider pairs that were not excluded ro prewous steps (mutual roformatton > 3 and resolwng power > 0 01) Though, each hnk Is not hnuted to pairs of words In fact, the 52 wider the hnk, the higher its relevance After processing a document, we often get overlapping pmrs For instance, m an amcle where the expression dos tr~s antJgos behgerantea (of the three former contenders) ts used repeatedly, the foll0vang pmrs were retrieved \[tr~s behgerantes\] \[an~gos behgerantes\] \[dos behgerantes\] 1 By ohserwng the overlap of these pmrs ro the very document, a single hnk can be retrieved, m the form of the tuple \[dos trOs antlgos behgerantes\] Adaptmg the roethod of Salton and Allan, we can formulate the hypothesis that the paragraph vath the larger number of hnks to other paragraphs would be of central impox~tance in the document In summary, the steps of the proposed method are *m a base corpus, compute the frequency of each word and the frequency of each co-occurrence, consadenng a window spanrong from posihon 14,-5 to w+5, *to each document c~mpute, smuIarly, the frequency of each word and each co-occurrence, *exclude, from the co-r.e~m'ences \]dent:fled m the document, those presenting a mutual mformatlon or a resolving power under the defined thresholds (I(x,y) < 3 or p < 0 01),  take the selected pans and group the overlapping ones, the resulting tuples (pairs and groups of pairs) occmTmg repeatedly ro different paragraphs estabhsh hnks between those paragraphs, *hypothetically, the paragraph presenting a larger number of hnk~ to other paragraphs wall be of central,mportanco in the document It should be noted that this proposal, compared to Salton and Allan's, has the advantages (at least ro theory) of avotchng the use, always arbitrary, of stop hsts 2, and of basing the calculations exclusively on the tuples that are relevant ro the document, instead of using the heavy vectors containing all the terms of each paragraph We don't have, so far, enough data to make any clmm about the comparative quahty of the links 1 pairs \[tr~s antlgos\] \[dos an#gos\], though considered relevant, didn't score enough mutuat reformat=on to be selected 2 the relevance of a word depends on the context, so, we prefer not to a pnon exclude any word, by sandtng it to a stop kst In fact, some of the tuplas we retheved as relevant include words that would otherw=se be pad of such a Ist An example m the pmr \[n~o ahnhados\] (nonaligned) where the word n,~o (not) though quite significant tn context, would be excluded wa stop #st . i I |j :!" ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:27	their aliases so that term frequency can be more accurately reflected, x e, 'IBM' and 'International Business Machine' are counted as two occurrences of the same term Another overt clue for chscourse cohesion and coherence is synonymous words When a theme of an article m developed throughout the text, synonymous words often appear as variants m the text In the example below, forinstance, 'pictures' and ~mages' are used interchangeably A new medzcal imaging technzque may someday be able to detect lung cancer and diseases of the bra:n earher than conventwnal methods, according to doctors at the State Un:vers,ty of New York, Stony Brook, and Princeton Un:verszty If doctors want to take pictures of the lungs, he noted, they have to use X-ray machines, ezpos:ng thezr pat:ents to doses of radtatzon :n the process The new technlque uses an anesthetfc, tenon gas, instead of water to create images of the body Although synonym sets have not proven effective in reformation retrieval for query expansion (Vorhees, 1994), we are using WordNet (Mallet et al, 1990) to link synonymous words m an article In the IR task, a query term is expanded with Its synonyms without dlsambxguatmg the senses of the term Thus, semantically irrelevant query terms are added, and the system typically retrieves more irrelevant documents, decreasing the precision Our summarization approach, in contrast, attempts to exploit WordNet synonym sets of only signature terms m a szngle document Our hypothesis m that if a synonym of a signature term extsts m the article, the term has been dlsamblgnated by the context of the article and the 'correct' synonym, not a synonym of the term in a different sense, m likely to co-occur in the same document In addition, morphological analysts allows us to link morphological variants of the same word within a document Morphological variants are often used to refer to the same concept throughout a document, 68 ! !" ></td>

combination method from a tralmng corpus automatically For training and evaluating our summa~ nzatlon system, we had a user create extract summaries by selecting relevant sentences m articles In order to compare with the results of a trainable summanzer reported by (Kuplec, Pedersen, and Chen, 1995), we first use Bayes' rules to learn the best scoring method Then, we will use an inductive learning algorithm such as the decusion tree algorithm (Qumlan, 1993) to learn summarization rules which can deal with feature dependencies across sentences 3 Evaluation Much research has been devoted to assessing correspondence between human and machine abstracts because of the complexity of analyzing 'ahoutness' as illustrated in (Hahn, 1990) As a result, most of the prehmmary evaluations of summarizatlon systerns have been developer-based A common aFproach IS to compare correspondence between automatlc performance and human performance (Rath, Restock, and Savage, 1961, Edmundson, 1969, Kuplec, Pedersen, and Chen, 1995) or summary accep~ ability (Brandow, Mltze, and Ran, 1995) Others have been task-based, comparing abstract and full text on~nals m terms of the browsing and search time (Mnke et al, 1994, Sumlta, Ono, and Mllke, 1993) or recall and precision m-document retrieval (Brandow, Mltze, and Ran, 1995) Our evaluation methodology us two-pronged First, we evaluate the system by scoring for correspondence with human generated extracts (Seco tlon 3 1) Second, m our future work we are collaborating with the Umverslty of Massachusetts to evaluate retrieval effectiveness for system-generated and human-generated summaries (Section 3 2) 3.1 Developer-based Evaluation The DlmSum development envtronment software incorporates automatic sconng software to calculate system recall and precision for any user's training or test data ThLs allows us to evaluate system performance for any user and for variatl0us m summary preferences We performed an informal experiment in which 6 users created summary extract versions of the same set of 15 texts These versions varied considerably among users, winch supports our view that a summarlzation system should he trained for user preference Then, we ran the DlmSum system over these 15 texts using multiple feature combinations (l e, combmatlous among names, synonyms, and morphologtcal variants), and scored against the six versions of summary extracts Though correspondence between the DlmSum summaries and user suminarles was low (ranging between 14% and 31% F-measures), clearly some feature sets were more effective for some users than for others For example, the best feature c0mbmatlon for the best-case correspondence between the user and DlmSum (l e, 31% case) was the combination of name, synonym and morphological mforinatlon On the other hand, the best combination for the worst-case correspondence between the user and DlmSum (l e, 14% case) was the combination of name and synonym reformation Some summary extracts, however, were not affected by different combinations of features The second step was to obtain a 'bottom-hne' score for a singl e user We ran the DlmSum system over a set of 86 texts using multiple feature combinatlous The features were combined by taking an average Of tf*ldf, tf or ldf scores of each token m a-sentence No training was performed We vaned the length of summaries (by changing/~ from 0 5 to 1 0), use of different types Of names (l e, person, place, and entity), use of abases, and use of synonyms for different parts of speech (l e, adjective, adverb, noun, and verb) Table 2 shows the top three F-measure scores (13), and the score for using the simplest baseline (4) For the best summary (1), place names were used winle person and entity ~ames were recognized but removed for sentence sconng Synonyms were also used The /c value was set to 0 65 (about 20-25% of a document as a summary) Use of aliases and synonyms chdn't make much difference m the scores (2-3) However, they all scored shghtly ingher than  the summary which &dn't use any of these features, i e, a summary which didn't use names, synonyms, or aliases (4) It Is interesting that using name tagging in a re70 verse way, 1 e, recogmzmg and then deleting person names from  sentence scoring, made a slgmficantly positive effect on summarization The best summary score with the person name used m sentence scoring was 38 6% (5) The.reason why person names made negative contnbutlous tothe summary seems ' to be because personal names were often mentioned as passing references (e g, names of spokespeople) m the corpus, but they had ingh ldf values Finally, m every feature combination, taking tf*ldf scores of each word outperformed the ldf-based calculation, and the latter m turn outperformed the if-based score calculation These results further motivate us to apply automated learning to combine summarization features The fact that humans vary m summarization suggests that recall/preclmon evaluation.is not meanmgful unless a summarization system Is trainable to a particular summary style Our current work is to identify through training what feature combinations produce an optimal summary for a given user We anticipate that the summary performance will improve with tralmng as DhmSum learns antomatlcally how or whether these, different mgna-." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:249	Our contributions are three-fold: an empirical comparison of a broad range of measures; a classification of similarity functions based on the information that they incorporate; and the introduction of a novel function that is superior at evaluating potential proxy distributions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:249	1 Introduction An inherent problem for statistical methods in natural language processing is that of sparse data -the inaccurate representation in any training corpus of the probability of low frequency events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:249	In particular, reasonable events that happen to not occur in the training set may mistakenly be assigned a probability of zero." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:249	These unseen events generally make up a substantial portion of novel data; for example, Essen and Steinbiss (1992) report that 12% of the test-set bigrams in a 75%-25% split of one million words did not occur in the training partition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:249	We consider here the question of how to estimate the conditional cooccurrence probability P(v\[n) of an unseen word pair (n, v) drawn from some finite set N x V. Two state-of-the-art technologies are Katz's (1987) backoff method and Jelinek and Mercer's (1980) interpolation method." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:249	Both use P(v) to estimate P(v\[n) when (n, v) is unseen, essentially ignoring the identity of n. An alternative approach is distance-weighted averaging, which arrives at an estimate for unseen cooccurrences by combining estimates for 25 cooccurrences involving similar words: 1 /P(v\[n) ---~-~mES(n) sim(n, m)P(v\[m) ~-\]mES(n) sim(n, m), (1) where S(n) is a set of candidate similar words and sim(n, m) is a function of the similarity between n and m. We focus on distributional rather than semantic similarity (e.g. , Resnik (1995)) because the goal of distance-weighted averaging is to smooth probability distributions -although the words 'chance' and 'probability' are synonyms, the former may not be a good model for predicting what cooccurrences the latter is likely to participate in." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:249	There are many plausible measures of distributional similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:249	In previous work (Dagan et al. , 1999), we compared the performance of three different functions: the Jensen-Shannon divergence (total divergence to the average), the L1 norm, and the confusion probability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:249	Our experiments on a frequency-controlled pseudoword disambiguation task showed that using any of the three in a distance-weighted averaging scheme yielded large improvements over Katz's backoff smoothing method in predicting unseen coocurrences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:249	Furthermore, by using a restricted version of model (1) that stripped incomparable parameters, we were able to empirically demonstrate that the confusion probability is fundamentally worse at selecting useful similar words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:249	D. Lin also found that the choice of similarity function can affect the quality of automatically-constructed thesauri to a statistically significant degree (1998a) and the ability to determine common morphological roots by as much as 49% in precision (1998b)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:249	1The term 'similarity-based', which we have used previously, has been applied to describe other models as well (L. Lee, 1997; Karov and Edelman, 1998)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:249	These empirical results indicate that investigating different similarity measures can lead to improved natural language processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:249	On the other hand, while there have been many similarity measures proposed and analyzed in the information retrieval literature (Jones and Furnas, 1987), there has been some doubt expressed in that community that the choice of similarity metric has any practical impact: Several authors have pointed out that the difference in retrieval performance achieved by different measures of association is insignificant, providing that these are appropriately normalised." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:249	(van Rijsbergen, 1979, pg." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:249	38) But no contradiction arises because, as van Rijsbergen continues, 'one would expect this since most measures incorporate the same information'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:249	In the language-modeling domain, there is currently no agreed-upon best similarity metric because there is no agreement on what the 'same information'the key data that a similarity function should incorporate -is. The overall goal of the work described here was to discover these key characteristics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:249	To this end, we first compared a number of common similarity measures, evaluating them in a parameter-free way on a decision task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:249	When grouped by average performance, they fell into several coherent classes, which corresponded to the extent to which the functions focused on the intersection of the supports (regions of positive probability) of the distributions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="22:249	This function yielded the best performance overall: an average error rate reduction of 4% (significant at the.01 level) with respect to the Jensen-Shannon divergence, the best predictor of unseen events in our earlier experiments (Dagan et al. , 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:249	Our contributions are thus three-fold: an empirical comparison of a broad range of similarity metrics using an evaluation methodology that factors out inessential degrees of freedom; a proposal, building on this comparison, of a characteristic for classifying similarity functions; and the introduction of a new similarity metric incorporating this characteristic that is superior at evaluating potential proxy distributions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="26:249	Let n and m be two nouns whose distributional similarity is to be determined; for notational simplicity, we write q(v) for P(vln ) and r(v) for P(vlm), their respective conditional verb cooccurrence probabilities." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="29:249	Note that Jaccard's coefficient differs from all the other measures we consider in that it is essentially combinatorial, being based only on the sizes of the supports of q, r, and q  r rather than the actual values of the distributions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:249	Previously, we found the Jensen-Shannon divergence (Rao, 1982; J. Lin, 1991) to be a useful measure of the distance between distributions: JS(q,r)=-~l \[D(q aVgq,r)+D(r aVgq,r) \] The function D is the KL divergence, which measures the (always nonnegative) average inefficiency in using one distribution to code for another (Cover and Thomas, 1991): (v) D(pl(V) IIp2(V)) = EPl(V)log Pl p2(v) ' V The function avga, r denotes the average distribution avgq,r(V ) --= (q(v)+r(v))/2; observe that its use ensures that the Jensen-Shannon divergence is always defined." ></td>

Finally, Kendall's % which appears in work on clustering similar adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Hatzivassiloglou, 1996), is a nonparametric measure of the association between random variables (Gibbons, 1993)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="28:153	1.1 Keyword Selection At the first stage, Korean keywords to be fed into the query translation process are extracted from a quasi-natural language query." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:153	This keyword selection is done with a morphological analyzer and a stochastic part-of-speech (POS) tagger for the Korean language (Shin et al. , 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:153	The role of the tagger is to help select the exact morpheme sequence from the multiple candidate sequences generated by the morphological analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:153	This process of employing a morphological analysis and a tagger is crucial for selecting legitimate query words from the topic statements because Korean is an agglutinative language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:153	Without the tagger, all the extraneous candidate keywords generated from the morphological analyzer will have to be entered into the translation process, which in and of itself will generate extraneous words, due to one-to-many mapping in the bilingual dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:153	1.2 Dictionary-Based Query Translation The second stage does the actual query translation based on a dictionary look-up, by applying both word-by-word translation and phrase-level translation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:153	For the correct identification of phrases in a Korean query, it would help to identify the lexical relations and produce statistical information on pairs of words in a text corpus as in Smadja (1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:153	Since the bilingual dictionary lacks some words that are essential for a correct interpretation of the Korean query, it is important to identify unknown words such as foreign words and transliterate them into English strings that need to be matched against an English dictionary (Jeong et al. , 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:153	1.3 Selection of the Correct Translations At the word disambiguation stage, we filter out the extraneous words generated blindly from the dictionary lookup process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:153	In addition to the POS tagger, we employed a bilingual word disambiguation technique using the cooccurrence information extracted from the collection of target documents." ></td>
	<td class="line o" title="38:153	More specifically, The mutual information statistics between pairs of words were used to determine whether English words from different sets generated by the translation process are 'compatible'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:153	In a sense, we make use of mutual disambiguation effect among query terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:153	More details are described in Section 3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:153	1.4 Query Term Weighting Finally, we apply our query term weighting technique to produce the final target query." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:153	The term weighting scheme basically reflects the degree of associations between the translated terms, and we give a high or low term weighting value according to the degree of mutual association between query terms." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="44:153	The result from the four stages is a set of query terms to be used in a 224 vector-space retrieval model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:153	2 Analysis of Translation Ambiguity Although an easy way to find translations of query terms is to use a bilingual dictionary, this method alone suffers from problems caused by translation ambiguity since there are often oneto-many correspondences in a bilingual dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:153	For example, in a Korean query consisting of three words, ':Z\]-o--~-5~\]-~7\] _Q_~'(ja-dong-cha gong-gi oh-yum) that means air pollution caused by automobiles, each word can be translated into multiple English words when a Korean-English dictionary is used in a straightforward way." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:153	The first word ':Z\]-o-~-5~\]-' (ja-dong-cha) of the query can be translated into English words with semantically similar but different words like 'motorcar', 'automobile', and 'car'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:153	The second word '--~-71' (gong-gi), a homonymous word, can be translated into English words with different meanings: 'air', 'atmosphere', 'empty vessel', and 'bowl'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:153	And the last word '_9--4' (oh-yum) can be translated into two English words, 'pollution' and 'contamination'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:153	Retaining multiple candidate words can be useful in promoting recall in monolingual IR system, but previous research indicates that failure to disambiguate the meanings of the words can hurt retrieval effectiveness tremendously." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:153	For instance, it is obvious that a phrase like empty vessel would change the meaning of the query entirely." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:153	Even a word like contamination, a synonym of pollution, may end up retrieving unrelated documents due to the slight differences in meaning." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:153	Along the same line of reasoning, we opted for a disambiguation approach that requires only a collection of documents in the target language, which is always available in any cross-language IR environment." ></td>
	<td class="line p" title="64:153	Since the goal of disambiguation is to select the best pair among many alternatives as described above, the mutual information statistic is a natural choice in judging the degree to which two words co-occur within a certain text boundary." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:211	Patrick Schone and Daniel Jurafsky University of Colorado, Boulder CO 80309 {schone, jurafsky}@cs.colorado.edu Abstract We seek a knowledge-free method for inducing multiword units from text corpora for use as machine-readable dictionary headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:211	We provide two major evaluations of nine existing collocation-finders and illustrate the continuing need for improvement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:211	We use Latent Semantic Analysis to make modest gains in performance, but we show the significant challenges encountered in trying this approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:211	1 Introduction A multiword unit (MWU) is a connected collocation: a sequence of neighboring words whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived from the meaning or connotation of its components (Choueka, 1988)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:211	In other words, MWUs are typically non-compositional at some linguistic level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:211	For example, phonological non-compositionality has been observed (Finke & Weibel, 1997; Gregory, et al, 1999) where words like got [gG3Ct] and to [tu] change phonetically to gotta [gG3CG72G46] when combined." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:211	We have interest in inducing headwords for machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), so our interest is in semantic rather than phonological non-compositionality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:211	As an example of semantic non-compositionality, consider compact disk: one could not deduce that it was a music medium by only considering the semantics of compact and disk. MWUs may also be non-substitutable and/or non-modifiable (Manning and Schtze, 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:211	Nonsubstitutability implies that substituting a word of the MWU with its synonym should no longer convey the same original content: compact disk does not readily imply densely-packed disk. Nonmodifiability, on the other hand, suggests one cannot modify the MWUs structure and still convey the same content: compact disk does not signify disk that is compact. MWU dictionary headwords generally satisfy at least one of these constraints." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:211	For example, a compositional phrase would typically be excluded from a hard-copy dictionary since its constituent words would already be listed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:211	These strategies allow hard-copy dictionaries to remain compact." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:211	As mentioned, we wish to find MWU headwords for machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:211	Although space is not an issue in MRDs, we desire to follow the lexicographic practice of reducing redundancy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:211	As Sproat indicated, 'simply expanding the dictionary to encompass every word one is ever likely to encounter is wrong: it fails to take advantage of regularities' (1992, p. xiii)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:211	Our goal is to identify an automatic, knowledge-free algorithm that finds all and only those collocations where it is necessary to supply a definition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:211	Knowledge-free means that the process should proceed without human input (other than, perhaps, indicating whitespace and punctuation)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:211	This seems like a solved problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:211	Many collocation-finders exist, so one might suspect that most could suffice for finding MWU dictionary headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:211	To verify this, we evaluate nine existing collocation-finders to see which best identifies valid headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:211	We evaluate using two completely separate gold standards: (1) WordNet and (2) a compendium of Internet dictionaries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:211	Although web-based resources are dynamic and have better coverage than WordNet (especially for acronyms and names), we show that WordNet-based scores are comparable to those using Internet MRDs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:211	Yet the evaluations indicate that significant improvement is still needed in MWU-induction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:211	As an attempt to improve MWU headword induction, we introduce several algorithms using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:211	LSA is a technique which automatically induces semantic relationships between words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:211	We use LSA to try to eliminate proposed MWUs which are semantically compositional." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:211	Unfortunately, this does not help." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:211	Yet when we use LSA to identify substitutable delimiters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:211	This suggests that in a language with MWUs, we do show modest performance gains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:211	whitespace, one might prefer to begin at the word 2 Previous Approaches For decades, researchers have explored various techniques for identifying interesting collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:211	There have essentially been three separate kinds of approaches for accomplishing this task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:211	These approaches could be broadly classified into (1) segmentation-based, (2) word-based and knowledgedriven, or (3) word-based and probabilistic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:211	We will illustrate strategies that have been attempted in each of the approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:211	Since we assume knowledge of whitespace, and since many of the first and all of the second categories rely upon human input, we will be most interested in the third category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:211	2.1 Segmentation-driven Strategies Some researchers view MWU-finding as a natural by-product of segmentation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:211	One can regard text as a stream of symbols and segmentation as a means of placing delimiters in that stream so as to separate logical groupings of symbols from one another." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:211	A segmentation process may find that a symbol stream should not be delimited even though subcomponents of the stream have been seen elsewhere." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:211	In such cases, these larger units may be MWUs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:211	The principal work on segmentation has focused either on identifying words in phonetic streams (Saffran, et." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:211	al, 1996; Brent, 1996; de Marcken, 1996) or on tokenizing Asian and Indian languages that do not normally include word delimiters in their orthography (Sproat, et al, 1996; Ponte and Croft 1996; Shimohata, 1997; Teahan, et al. , 2000; and many others)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:211	Such efforts have employed various strategies for segmentation, including the use of hidden Markov models, minimum description length, dictionary-based approaches, probabilistic automata, transformation-based learning, and text compression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:211	Some of these approaches require significant sources of human knowledge, though others, especially those that follow data compression or HMM schemes, do not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:211	These approaches could be applied to languages where word delimiters exist (such as in European languages delimited by the space character)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:211	However, in such languages, it seems more prudent to simply take advantage of delimiters rather than introducing potential errors by trying to find word boundaries while ignoring knowledge of the level and identify appropriate word combinations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:211	2.2 Word-based, knowledge-driven Strategies Some researchers start with words and propose MWU induction methods that make use of parts of speech, lexicons, syntax or other linguistic structure (Justeson and Katz, 1995; Jacquemin, et al. , 1997; Daille, 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:211	For example, Justeson and Katz indicated that the patterns NOUN NOUN and ADJ NOUN are very typical of MWUs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:211	Daille also suggests that in French, technical MWUs follow patterns such as NOUN de NOUN' (1996, p. 50)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:211	To find word combinations that satisfy such patterns in both of these situations necessitates the use of a lexicon equipped with part of speech tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:211	Since we are interested in knowledge-free induction of MWUs, these approaches are less directly related to our work." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:211	Furthermore, we are not really interested in identifying constructs such as general noun phrases as the above rules might generate, but rather, in finding only those collocations that one would typically need to define." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:211	2.3 Word-based, Probabilistic Approaches The third category assumes at most whitespace and punctuation knowledge and attempts to infer MWUs using word combination probabilities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:211	Table 1 (see next page) shows nine commonly-used probabilistic MWU-induction approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:211	In the table, f and P signify frequency and probability XX of a word X. A variable XY indicates a word bigram and indicates its expected frequency at random." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:211	XY An overbar signifies a variables complement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:211	For more details, one can consult the original sources as well as Ferreira and Pereira (1999) and Manning and Schtze (1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:211	3 Lexical Access Prior to applying the algorithms, we lemmatize using a weakly-informed tokenizer that knows only that whitespace and punctuation separate words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:211	Punctuation can either be discarded or treated as words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:211	Since we are equally interested in finding units like Dr. and U. S., we opt to treat punctuation as words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:211	Once we tokenize, we use Churchs (1995) suffix array approach to identify word n-grams that occur at least T times (for T=10)." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="61:211	Since we need knowledge-poor Daille, 1996) induction, we cannot use human-suggested filtering Chi-squared (G24 ) 2 (Church and Gale, 1991) Z-Score (Smadja, 1993; Fontenelle, et al. , 1994) Students t-Score (Church and Hanks, 1990) n-gram list in accordance to each probabilistic algorithm." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:211	This task is non-trivial since most algorithms were originally suited for finding twoword collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:211	We must therefore decide how to expand the algorithms to identify general n-grams (say, C=w ww )." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:211	We can either generalize or 12 n approximate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:211	Since generalizing requires exponential compute time and memory for several of the algorithms, approximation is an attractive alternative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:211	One approximation redefines X and Y to be, respectively, the word sequences www and 12 i www where i is chosen to maximize P P . i+1 i+2 n, X Y This has a natural interpretation of being the expected probability of concatenating the two most probable substrings in order to form the larger unit." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:211	Since it can be computed rapidly with low memory costs, we use this approximation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:211	Two additional issues need addressing before evaluation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:211	The first regards document sourcing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:211	If an n-gram appears in multiple sources (eg., Congressional Record versus Associated Press), its likelihood of accuracy should increase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:211	This is particularly true if we are looking for MWU headwords for a general versus specialized dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:211	Phrases that appear in one source may in fact be general MWUs, but frequently, they are text-specific units." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:211	Hence, precision gained by excluding single-source n-grams may be worth losses in recall." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:211	We will measure this trade-off." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:211	Second, evaluating with punctuation as words and applying no filtering mechanism may unfairly bias against some algorithms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:211	Preor post-processing of n-grams with a linguistic filter has shown to improve some induction algorithms performance rules as in Section 2.2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:211	Yet we can filter by pruning n-grams whose beginning or ending word is among the top N most frequent words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:211	This unfortunately eliminates acronyms like U. S. and phrasal verbs like throw up. However, discarding some words may be worthwhile if the final list of n-grams is richer in terms of MRD headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:211	We therefore evaluate with such an automatic filter, arbitrarily (and without optimization) choosing N=75." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:211	4 Evaluating Performance A natural scoring standard is to select a language and evaluate against headwords from existing dictionaries in that language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:211	Others have used similar standards (Daille, 1996), but to our knowledge, none to the extent described here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:211	We evaluate thousands of hypothesized units from an unconstrained corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:159	This method combines word repetition and the lexical cohesion stated by a collocation network to compensate for the respective weaknesses of the two approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:159	We report an evaluation of our method for segmentation on two corpora, one in French and one in English, and we propose an evaluation measure that specifically suits that kind of systems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:159	1 Introduction Topic analysis, which aims at identifying the topics of a text, delimiting their extend and finding the relations between the resulting segments, has recently raised an important interest." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:159	The largest part of it was dedicated to topic segmentation, also called linear text segmentation, and to the TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) initiative (Fiscus et al. , 1999), which addresses all the tasks we have mentioned but from a domain-dependent viewpoint and not necessarily in an integrated way." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:159	Systems that implement this work can be categorized according to what kind of knowledge they use." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:159	Most of those that achieve text segmentation only rely on the intrinsic characteristics of texts: word distribution, as in (Hearst, 1997), (Choi, 2000) and (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), or linguistic cues as in (Passonneau and Litman, 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:159	They can be applied without restriction about domains but have low results when a text doesnt characterize its topical structure by surface clues." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:159	Some systems exploit domain-independent knowledge about lexical cohesion: a network of words built from a dictionary in (Kozima, 1993); a large set of collocations collected from a corpus in (Ferret, 1998), (Kaufmann, 1999) and (Choi, 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:159	To some extend, this knowledge permits these systems to discard some false topical shifts without losing their independence with regard to domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:159	The last main type of systems relies on knowledge about the topics they may encounter in the texts they process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:159	This is typically the kind of approach developed in TDT where this knowledge is automatically built from a set of reference texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:159	The work of Bigi (Bigi et al. , 1998) stands in the same perspective but focuses on much larger topics than TDT." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:159	These systems have a limited scope due to their topic representations but they are also more precise for the same reason." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:159	Hybrid systems that combine the approaches we have presented were also developed and illustrated the interest of such a combination: (Jobbins and Evett, 1998) combined word recurrence, collocations and a thesaurus; (Beeferman et al. , 1999) relied on both collocations and linguistic cues." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:159	The topic analysis we propose implements such a hybrid approach: it relies on a general language resource, a collocation network, but exploits it together with word recurrence in texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:159	Moreover, it simultaneously achieves topic segmentation and link detection, i.e. determining whether two segments discuss the same topic." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:159	2 Overview of TOPICOLL In accordance with much work about discourse analysis, TOPICOLL processes texts linearly: it detects topic shifts and finds links between segments without delaying its decision, i.e., by only taking into account the part of text that has been already analyzed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:159	A window that delimits the current focus of the analysis is moved over each text to be processed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:159	This window contains the lemmatized content words of the text, resulting from its pre-processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:159	A topic context is associated to this focus window." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:159	It is made up of both the words of the window and the words that are selected from a collocation network1 as strongly linked to the words of the window." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:159	The current segment is also given a topic context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:159	This context results from the fusion of the contexts associated to the focus window when this window was in the segment space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:159	A topic shift is then detected when the context of the focus window and the context of the current segment are not similar any more for several successive positions of the focus window." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:159	This process also performs link detection by comparing the topic context of each new segment to the context of the already delimited segments." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:159	The use of a collocation network permits TOPICOLL to find relations beyond word recurrence and to associate a richer topical representation to segments, which facilitates tasks such as link detection or topic identification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:159	But work such as (Kozima, 1993), (Ferret, 1998) or (Kaufmann, 1999) showed that using a domainindependent source of knowledge for text segmentation doesnt necessarily lead to get better results than work that is only based on word distribution in texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:159	One of the reasons of this fact is that these methods dont precisely control the relations they select or dont take into account the sparseness of their knowledge." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:159	Hence, while they discard some incorrect topic shifts found by methods based on word recurrence, they also find incorrect shifts when the relevant relations are not present in their knowledge or dont find some correct shifts because of the selection of non relevant relations from a topical viewpoint." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:159	By combining word recurrence and relations selected from a collocation network, TOPICOLL aims at exploiting a domain-independent source of knowledge for text segmentation in a more accurate way." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="38:159	The building process was the same for the two networks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:159	First, the initial corpus was preprocessed in order to characterize texts by their topically significant words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:159	Thus, we retained only the lemmatized form of plain words, that is, nouns, verbs and adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="41:159	Collocations were extracted according to the method described in (Church and Hanks, 1990) by moving a window on texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:159	Parameters were chosen in order to catch topical relations: the window was rather large, 20-word wide, and took into account the boundaries of texts; moreover, collocations were indifferent to word order." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:159	We also adopted an evaluation of mutual information as a cohesion measure of each collocation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:159	This measure was normalized according to the maximal mutual information relative to the considered corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="13:154	Phraseness is a somewhat abstract notion which describes the degree to which a given word sequence is considered to be a phrase." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:154	Although there is no single definition of the term phrase, in this paper, we focus on collocation or cohesion of consecutive words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:154	Informativeness refers to how well a phrase captures or illustrates the key ideas in a set of documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:154	Because informativeness is defined with respect to background information and new knowledge, users will have different perceptions of informativeness." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:154	In our calculations, we make use of the relationship between foreground and background corpora to formalize the notion of informativeness." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:154	The target document set from which representative keyphrases are extracted is called the foreground corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:154	The document set to which this target set is compared is called the background corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:154	For example, a foreground corpus of the current weeks news would be compared to a background corpus of an entire news article archive to determine that certain phrases, like press conference are typical of news stories in general and do not capture the particulars of current events in the way that national museum of antiquities does." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:154	Other examples of foreground and background corpora include: a web site for a certain company and web data in general; a newsgroup and the whole Usenet archive; and research papers of a certain conference and research papers in general." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:154	In order to get a ranked keyphrase list, we need to combine both phraseness and informativeness into a single score." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:154	A sequence of words can be a good phrase but not an informative one, like the expression in spite of.

	<td class="line x" title="38:154	The basic idea of using BLRT for text analysis is to consider a word sequence as a repeated sequence of binary trials comparing each word in a corpus to a target word, and use the likelihood ratio of two hypotheses that (i) two events, observed a0a2a1 times out of a3a4a1 total tokens and a0a6a5 times out of a3a7a5 total tokens respectively, are drawn from different distributions and (ii) from the same distribution." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:166	In this article, we present a possible solution to overcome these limits by defining the sense of words from the way they are used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:166	More precisely, we propose to differentiate the senses of a word from a network of lexical cooccurrences built from a large corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:166	This method was tested both for French and English and was evaluated for English by comparing its results with WordNet." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:166	1 Introduction Semantic resources have proved to be useful in information retrieval and information extraction for applications such as query expansion (Voorhees, 1998), text summarization (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 2002) or question/answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:166	But this work has also shown that these resources must be used with caution: they bring on an improvement of results only if word sense disambiguation is performed with a great accuracy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:166	These findings bring one of the first roles of a semantic resource to light: discriminating and characterizing the senses of a set of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:166	The main semantic resources with a wide coverage that can be exploited by computers are lexico-semantic networks such as WordNet." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:166	Because of the way they were built, mainly by hand, these networks are not fundamentally different from traditional dictionaries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:166	Hence, it is not very surprising that they were criticized, as in (Harabagiu et al. , 1999), for not being suitable for Natural Language Processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:166	They were criticized both about the nature of the senses they discriminate and the way they characterize them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:166	Their senses are considered as too fine-grained but also incomplete." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:166	Moreover, they are generally defined through their relations with synonyms, hyponyms and hyperonyms but not by elements that describe the contexts in which they occur." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:166	One of the solutions for solving this problem consists in automatically discovering the senses of words from corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:166	Each sense is defined by a list of words that is not restricted to synonyms or hyperonyms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:166	The work done in this area can be divided into three main trends." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:166	The first one, represented by (Pantel and Lin, 2002), is not focused on the problem of discovering word senses: its main objective is to build classes of equivalent words from a distributionalist viewpoint, hence to gather words that are mainly synonyms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:166	In the case of (Pantel and Lin, 2002), the discovering of word senses is a side effect of the clustering algorithm, Cluster By Committee, used for building classes of words: as a word can belong to several classes, each of them can be considered as one of its senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:166	The second main trend, found in (Schtze, 1998), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Purandare, 2003), represents each instance of a target word by a set of features that occur in its neighborhood and applies an unsupervised clustering algorithm to all its instances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:166	Each cluster is then considered as a sense of the target word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:166	The last trend, explored by (Vronis, 2003), (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) and (Rapp, 2003), starts from the cooccurrents of a word recorded from a corpus and builds its senses by gathering its cooccurrents according to their similarity or their dissimilarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:166	Our work takes place in this last trend." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:166	2 Overview The starting point of the method we present in this article is a network of lexical cooccurrences, that is a graph whose vertices are the significant words of a corpus and edges represent the cooccurrences between these words in the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:166	The discovering of word senses is performed word by word and the processing of a word only relies on the subgraph that contains its cooccurrents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:166	The first step of the method consists in building a matrix of similarity between these cooccurrents by exploiting their relations in the subgraph." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:166	An unsupervised clustering algorithm is then applied for grouping these cooccurrents and giving rise to the senses of the considered word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:166	This method, as the ones presented in (Vronis, 2003), (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) and (Rapp, 2003), relies on the following hypothesis: in the subgraph gathering the cooccurrents of a word, the number of relations between the cooccurrents defining a sense is higher than the number of relations that these cooccurrents have with those defining the other senses of the considered word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:166	The clustering algorithm that we use is an adaptation of the Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN) algorithm presented in (Ertz et al. , 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:166	This algorithm particularly fits our problem as it automatically determines the number of clusters, in our case the number of senses of a word, and does not take into account the elements that are not representative of the clusters it builds." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:166	This last point is especially important for our application as there is a lot of noise among the cooccurrents of a word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:166	3 Networks of lexical cooccurrences The method we present in this article for discovering word senses was applied both for French and English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:166	Hence, two networks of lexical cooccurrences were built: one for French, from the Le Monde newspaper (24 months between 1990 and 1994), and one for English, from the L.A. Times newspaper (2 years, part of the TREC corpus)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:166	The size of each corpus was around 40 million words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:166	The building process was the same for the two networks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:166	First, the initial corpus was preprocessed in order to characterize texts by their topically significant words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:166	Thus, we retained only the lemmatized form of plain words, that is, nouns, verbs and adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:166	Cooccurrences were classically extracted by moving a fixed-size window on texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:166	Parameters were chosen in order to catch topical relations: the window was rather large, 20word wide, and took into account the boundaries of texts; moreover, cooccurrences were indifferent to word order." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="39:166	As (Church and Hanks, 1990), we adopted an evaluation of mutual information as a cohesion measure of each cooccurrence." ></td>
	<td class="line o" title="40:166	This measure was normalized according to the maximal mutual information relative to the considered corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:166	After filtering the less significant cooccurrences (cooccurrences with less than 10 occurrences and cohesion lower than 0.1), we got a network with approximately 23,000 words and 5.2 million cooccurrences for French, 30,000 words and 4.8 million cooccurrences for English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:166	4 Word sense discovery algorithm 4.1 Building of the similarity matrix between cooccurrents The number and the extent of the clusters built by a clustering algorithm generally depend on a set of parameters that can be tuned in one way or another." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:194	3.1 Structure of HowNet Different from WordNet or other synonyms dictionary, HowNet describes words as a set of concepts and each concept is described by a set of primitives." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="68:194	3.2 Similarity Model Based on HowNet Liu Qun (Liu 2002) defined word similarity as two words which can substitute each other in the same context and still maintain the sentence consistent syntactically and semantically." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:194	This is very close to our definition of synonyms." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="72:194	Thus, HowNet can be described by W, a collection of n words, as: W = { w 1, w 2,  w n }Each word w i is, in turn, described by a set of concepts S as: W i = { S i1, S i2, S ix }, And, each concept S i is, in turn, described by a set of primitives: S i = { p i1, p i2 p iy } For each word pair, w 1 and w 2, the similarity function is defined by )1(),(max),( 21 1,1 21 ji mjni SSSimwwSim == = where S 1i is the list of concepts associated with W 1 and S 2j is the list of concepts associated with W 2 . As any concept S i is presented by its primitives, the similarity of primitives for any p 1, and p 2 of the same type, can be expressed by the following formula:   + = ),( ),( 21 21 ppDis ppSim (2) where  is an adjustable parameter set to 1.6, and ),( 21 ppDis is the path length between p 1 and p 2 based on the semantic tree structure." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="51:271	2 Overview and Design Principles The objective of this project is to manually construct a large shallow Treebank with high accuracy and consistency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:271	The design principles of The PolyU Treebank are: high resource sharing ability, low structural complexity, sufficient syntactic information and large data scale." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:271	First of all, the design and construction of The PolyU Treebank aims to provide as much a general purpose Treebank as possible so that different applications can make use of it as a NLP resource." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:271	With this objective, we chose to follow the well-known Phrase-based Grammar as the framework for annotation as this grammar is widely accepted by Chinese language researchers, and thus our work can be easily understood and accepted." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:271	Due to the lack of word delimitation in Chinese, word segmentation must be performed before any further syntactical annotation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:271	High accuracy of word segmentation is very important for this project." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:271	In this project, we chose to use the segmented and tagged corpus of People Daily annotated by the Peking University." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:271	The annotated corpus contains articles appeared in the People Daily Newspaper in 1998." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:271	The segmentation is based on the guidelines, given in the Chinese national standard GB13715, (Liu et al. 1993) and the POS tagging specification was developed according to the Grammatical Knowledge-base of contemporary Chinese." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:271	According to the report from Peking University, the accuracy of this annotated corpus in terms of segmentation and POS tagging are 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively (Yu et al. 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:271	The use of such mature and widely adopted resource can effectively reduce our cost, ensure syntactical annotation quality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:271	With consistency in segmentation, POS, and syntactic annotation, the resulting Treebank can be readily shared by other researchers as a public resource." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:271	The second design principle is low structural complexity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:271	That means, the annotation framework should be clear and simple, and the labeled syntactic and functional information should be commonly used and accepted." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:271	Considering the characteristics of shallow annotation, our project has focused on the annotation of phrases and headwords while the sentence level syntax are ignored." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:271	Following the framework of Phrase-based Grammar, a base-phrase is regarded as the smallest unit where a base-phrase is defined as a stable and simple phrase without nesting components." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:271	Study on Chinese syntactical analysis suggests that phrases should be the fundamental unit instead of words in a sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:271	This is because, firstly, the usage of Chinese words is very flexible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:271	A word may have different POS tags serving for different functions in sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:271	On the contrary, the use of Chinese phrases is much more stable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:271	That is, a phrase has very limited functional use in a sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:271	Secondly, the construction rules of Chinese phrases are nearly the same as that of Chinese sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:271	Therefore, the analysis of phrases can help identifying POS and grammatical functions of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:271	Naturally, it should be regarded as the basic syntactical unit." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:271	Usually, a base-phrase is driven by a lexical word as its headword." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:271	Examples of base-phrases include base NP, base VP and so on, such as the sample shown below." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:271	Using base-phrases as the start point, nested levels of phrases are then identified, until the maximum phrases (will be defined later) are identified." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:271	Since we do not intend to provide full parsing information, there has to be a limit on the level of nesting." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:271	For practical reasons, we choose to limit the nesting of brackets to 3 levels." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:271	That means, the depth of our shallow parsed Treebank will be limited to 3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:271	This restriction can limit the structural complexity to a manageable level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:271	Our nested bracketing is not strictly bottom up." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:271	That is we do not simply extend from base-phrase and move up until the 3 rd level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:271	Instead, we first identify the maximal-phrase which is used to identify the backbone of the sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:271	The maximal-phrase provides the framework under which the base-phrases of up to 2 levels can be identified." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:271	The principles for the identification of scope and depth of phrase bracketing are briefly explained below and the operating procedure is indicated by the given order in which these principles are presented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:271	More details is given in Section 5." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:271	Step 1: Annotation of maximal-phrase which is the shortest word sequence of maximally spanning non-overlapping edges which plays a distinct semantic role of a predicate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:271	A maximal-phrase contains two or more lexical words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:271	Step 2: Annotation of base-phrases within a maximal-phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:271	In case a base-phrase and a maximal-phrase are identical and the maximal-phrase is already bracketed in Step 1, no bracketing is done in this step." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:271	For each identified base-phrase, its headword will be marked." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:271	Step 3: Annotation of next level of bracketing, called mid-phrase which is expended from a base-phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:271	A mid-phrase is annotated only if it is deemed necessary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:271	The process starts from the identified base-phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:271	One more level of syntactical structure is then bracketed if it exists within the maximal-phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:271	The third design principle is to provide sufficient syntactical information for natural language application even though shallow annotation does not necessarily contain complete syntactic information at sentence level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:271	Some past research in Chinese shallow parsing were on single level base-phrases only (Sun 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:271	However, for certain applications, such as for collocation extraction, identification of base-phrases only are not very useful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:271	In this project, we have decided to annotate phrases within three levels of nesting within a sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:271	For each phrase, a label is be given to indicate its syntactical information, and an optional semantic or structural label is given if applicable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:271	Furthermore, the headword of a base-phrase is annotated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:271	We believe these information are sufficient for many natural language processing research work and it is also manageable for this project within its working schedule." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="12:158	Actually, we propose to build an associative network by enriching an existing electronic dictionary (essentially) with (syntagmatic) associations coming from a corpus, representing the average citizens shared, basic knowledge of the world (encyclopedia)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="40:158	For some concrete proposals going in this direction, see (Bilac et al. , 2004), or the OneLook reverse dictionary.4 Besides the definition information, people often have other kind of knowledge concerning the target word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:158	In particular, they know how the latter relates to other words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:158	Actually the very notion of association goes back at least to Aristotle (350BC), but it is also inherent in work done by philosophers (Locke, Hume), physiologists (James & Stuart Mills), psychologists (Galton, 1880; Freud, 1901; Jung and Riklin, 1906) and psycholinguists (Deese, 1965; Jenkins, 1970; Schvaneveldt, 1989)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="51:158	The notion of association is also implicit in work on semantic networks (Quillian, 1968), hypertext (Bush, 1945), the web (Nelson, 1967), connectionism (Dell et al. , 1999) and, of course, in WordNet (Miller et al. , 1993; Fellbaum, 1998)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="53:158	Of course, they are very different." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:158	Yet, not knowing what a concept looks like (a single node, or every node, i.e. headword of the words definition?), we think it is safer to assume that the user can communicate with the computer (dictionary) only via words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:158	Hence, concepts are represented by words, yet, since the two are connected, one can be accessed via the other, which addresses the interface problem with the computer." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:158	Another point worth mentionning is the fact that associations may depend on the nature of the arguments (words vs. concepts)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:158	While in theory anything can be associated with anything (words with words, words with concepts, concepts with concepts, etc.), in practice words tend to trigger a different set of associations than concepts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:158	Also, the connectivity between words and concepts explains to some extent the power and the flexibility of the human mind." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:158	Words are shorthand labels for concepts, and given the fact that the two are linked, one can make big leaps in no time and easily move from one plane (lets say the conceptual level) to the other (the linguistic counterpart)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="61:158	Compared to the links between concepts which are a superhighway, associations between words are more like countryroads." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:158	7Actually, one could question the very notion of mental dictionary which is convenient, but misleading in as it supposes a dedicated part for this task in our brain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:158	A Figure 1: Search based on propagation in a network (internal representation) word amounts thus to entering the network and following the links leading from the source node (the first word that comes to your mind) to the target word (the one you are looking for)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:158	Suppose you wanted to find the word nurse (target word), yet the only token coming to your mind were hospital." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:158	In this case the system would generate internally a graph with the source word at the center and all the associated words at the periphery." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:158	Put differently, the system would build internally a semantic network with hospital in the center and all its associated words as satellites (figure 1).8 Obviously, the greater the number of associations, the more complex the graph." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="71:158	Readability is hampered by at least two factors: high connectivity (the great number of links or associations emanating from each word), and distribution: conceptually related nodes, that is, nodes activated by the same kind of assocation are scattered around, that is, they do not necessarily occur next to each other, which is quite confusing for the user." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:158	In order to solve this problem we suggest to display by category (chunks) all the words linked by the same kind of association to the source word (see figure 2)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="82:158	Word access, as described here, amounts to navigating in a huge associative network." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:158	Of course, such a network has to be built." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:158	The question is how." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:158	Our proposal is to build it automatically by parsing an existing corpus containing sufficient amount of information on world knowledge (for example, an encyclopedia)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:158	This would yield a set of associations (see below),9 which still need to be labeled." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:158	A rich ontology should be helpful in determining the adequate label for many, if not most of the links." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="91:158	Take for example the word elephant." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:158	An electronic dictionary like Word Net associates the following gloss with the headword: large, gray, four-legged mammal, while Webster gives the following information: A mammal of the order Proboscidia, of which two living species, Elephas Indicus and E. Africanus, and several fossil species, are known." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:158	They have a proboscis or trunk, and two large ivory tusks proceeding from the extremity of the upper jaw, and curving upwards." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:158	The molar teeth are large and have transverse folds." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:158	Elephants are the largest land animals now existing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:158	While this latter entry is already quite rich (trunk, ivory tusk, size), an encyclopedia contains even more information.12 If all this information were added to an electronic resource, it would enable us to access the same word (e.g. elephant) via many more associations than ever before." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:158	By looking at the definition here above, one will notice that many associations are quite straightforward (color, size, origin, etc.), and since most of them appear frequently in a pattern-like manner it should be possible to extract them automatically (see footnote 18 below)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:158	If one agrees with these views, the remaining question is how to extract this encyclopedic information and to add it to an existing electronic resource." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:158	Below we will outline some methods for extracting associated words and discuss the feasibility of using current methodology to achieve this goal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:158	5 Automatic extraction of word associations Above we outlined the need for obtaining associations between words and using them to improve dictionary accessibility." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:158	While the associations can be obtained through association experiments with human subjects, this strategy is specific animal, trip or location (zoo, country in Africa)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:158	11This does not (and should not) preclude the possibility to add it to ones personal dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:158	12You may consider taking a look at Wikipedia (http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) which is free." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:158	not very satisfying due to the high cost of running the experiments (time and money), and due to its static nature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:158	Indeed, given the costs, it is impossible to repeat these experiments to take into account the evolution of a society." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:158	Hence, the goal is to automatically extract associations from large corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:158	This problem was addressed by a large number of researchers, but in most cases it was reduced to extraction of collocations which are a proper subset of the set of associated words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:158	While hard to define, collocations appear often enough in corpora to be extractable by statistical and information-theory based methods." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="109:158	There are several basic methods for evaluating associations between words: based on frequency counts (Choueka, 1988; Wettler and Rapp, 1993), information theoretic (Church and Hanks, 1990) and statistical significance (Smadja, 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:158	The statistical significance often evaluate whether two words are independant using hypothesis tests such as t-score (Church et al. , 1991), the X2, the log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993) and Fishers exact test (Pedersen, 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:158	Extracted sets for associated words are further pruned using numerical methods, or linguistic knowledge to obtain a subset of collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:158	The various extraction measures have been discussed in great detail in the literature (Manning and Schutze, 1999; McKeown and Radev, 2000), their performance has been compared (Dunning, 1993; Pedersen, 1996; Evert and Krenn, 2001), and the methods have been combined to improve overall performance (Inkpen and Hirst, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:158	Most of these methods were originally applied in large text corpora, but more recently the web has been used as a corpus (Pearce, 2001; Inkpen and Hirst, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="114:158	Collocation extraction methods have been used not only for English, but for many other languages: French (Ferret, 2002), German (Evert and Krenn, 2001) and Japanese (Nagao and Mori, 1994), to cite but those." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="115:158	The most obvious question in this context is to clarify to what extent available collocation extraction techniques fulfill our needs of extracting and labeling word associations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="116:158	Since collocations are a subset of association, it is possible to apply collocation extraction techniques to obtain related words, ordered in terms of the relative strength of association." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="117:158	The result of this kind of numerical extraction would be a large set of numerically weighted word pairs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="118:158	The problem with this approach is that the links are only labeled in terms of their relative associative strength, but not categorically, which makes it impossible to group and present them in a meaningful way for the dictionary user." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="119:158	Clusters based only on the notion of association strength are inadequate for the kind of navigation described here above." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="120:158	Hence another step is necessary: qualification of the links according to their types." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:158	Only once this is done, a human being could use it to navigate through a large conceptual-lexical network (the dictionary) as described above." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:158	Unfortunately, research on automatic link identification has been rather sparse." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="123:158	Most attempts have been devoted to the extraction of certain types of links (usually syntactic type (Lin, 1998) or on extensions of WordNet with topical information contained in a thesaurus (Stevenson, 2002) or on the WWW (Agirre et al. , 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="124:158	Additional methods need to be considered in order to reveal (automatically) the kind of associations holding between words and/or concepts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="125:158	Earlier in this paper we have suggested the use of an encyclopedia as a source of general world knowledge." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="126:158	It should be noted, though, that there are important differences between large corpora and encyclopedias." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="127:158	Large corpora usually contain a lot of repetitive texts on a limited number of topics (e.g. newspaper articles) which makes them very suitable for statistical methods." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="128:158	On the other hand, while being maximally informative and comprehensive, encyclopedias are written in a highly controlled language, and their content is continually updated and re-edited, with the goal to avoid unnecessary repetition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="129:158	While most of the information contained in an entry is important, there is a lack of redundancy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="130:158	Hence, measures capable of handling word pairs with low appearance counts (e.g. log-likelihood or Fishers exact test) should be favored." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="131:158	Also, rather than looking at individual words, one might want to look at word patterns instead." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="132:158	6 Discussion and Conclusion We have raised and partially answered the question of how a dictionary should be indexed in order to support word access." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="133:158	We were particularly concerned with the language producer, as his needs (and knowledge at the onset) are quite different from the ones of the language receiver (listener/reader)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="134:158	It seems that, in order to achieve our goal, we need to do two things: add to an existing electronic dictionary information that people tend to associate with a word, that is, build and enrich a semantic network, and provide a tool to navigate in it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="135:158	To this end we have suggested to label the links, as this would reduce the graph complexity and allow for type-based navigation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="136:158	Actually our basic proposal is to extend a resource like WordNet by adding certain links, in particular on the horizontal axis (syntagmatic relations)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="137:158	These links are associations, and their role consists in helping the encoder to find ideas (concepts/words) related to a given stimulus (brainstorming), or to find the word he is thinking of (word access)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="138:158	One problem that we are confronted with is to identify possible associations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="139:158	Ideally we would need a complete list, but unfortunately, this does not exist." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="140:158	Yet, there is a lot of highly relevant information out there." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="141:158	For example, Melcuks lexical functions (Melcuk, 1992), Fillmores FRAMENET13, work on ontologies (CYC), thesaurus (Roget), WordNets (the original version from Princeton, divers EuroWordNets, BalkaNet), HowNet14, the work done by MICRA, the FACTOTUM project15 or the Wordsmyth dictionary/thesaurus combination16." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="142:158	Of course, one would need to make choices here and probably add links." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:157	Evaluation of this measure, the mutual rank ratio metric, shows that it produces better results than standard statistical measures when applied to this task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:157	1 Introduction The ordinary vocabulary of a language like English contains thousands of phrasal terms -multiword lexical units including compound nouns, technical terms, idioms, and fixed collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:157	The exact number of phrasal terms is difficult to determine, as new ones are coined regularly, and it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a phrase is a fixed term or a regular, compositional expression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:157	Accurate identification of phrasal terms is important in a variety of contexts, including natural language parsing, question answering systems, information retrieval systems, among others." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:157	Insofar as phrasal terms function as lexical units, their component words tend to cooccur more often, to resist substitution or paraphrase, to follow fixed syntactic patterns, and to display some degree of semantic noncompositionality (Manning, 1999:183-186)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:157	However, none of these characteristics are amenable to a simple algorithmic interpretation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:157	It is true that various term extraction systems have been developed, such as Xtract (Smadja 1993), Termight (Dagan & Church 1994), and TERMS (Justeson & Katz 1995) among others (cf.Daille 1996, Jacquemin & Tzoukermann 1994, Jacquemin, Klavans, & Toukermann 1997, Boguraev & Kennedy 1999, Lin 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:157	Such systems typically rely on a combination of linguistic knowledge and statistical association measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:157	Grammatical patterns, such as adjective-noun or noun-noun sequences are selected then ranked statistically, and the resulting ranked list is either used directly or submitted for manual filtering." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:157	The linguistic filters used in typical term extraction systems have no obvious connection with the criteria that linguists would argue define a phrasal term (noncompositionality, fixed order, nonsubstitutability, etc.)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:157	They function, instead, to reduce the number of a priori improbable terms and thus improve precision." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:157	The association measure does the actual work of distinguishing between terms and plausible nonterms." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="16:157	A variety of methods have been applied, ranging from simple frequency (Justeson & Katz 1995), modified frequency measures such as c-values (Frantzi, Anadiou & Mima 2000, Maynard & Anadiou 2000) and standard statistical significance tests such as the t-test, the chi-squared test, and loglikelihood (Church and Hanks 1990, Dunning 1993), and information-based methods, e.g. pointwise mutual information (Church & Hanks 1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:157	Several studies of the performance of lexical association metrics suggest significant room for improvement, but also variability among tasks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:157	One series of studies (Krenn 1998, 2000; Evert & Krenn 2001, Krenn & Evert 2001; also see Evert 2004) focused on the use of association metrics to identify the best candidates in particular grammatical constructions, such as adjective-noun pairs or verb plus prepositional phrase constructions, and compared the performance of simple frequency to several common measures (the log-likelihood, the t-test, the chi-squared test, the dice coefficient, relative entropy and mutual information)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:157	In Krenn & Evert 2001, frequency outperformed mutual information though not the ttest, while in Evert and Krenn 2001, log-likelihood and the t-test gave the best results, and mutual information again performed worse than frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:157	However, in all these studies performance was generally low, with precision falling rapidly after the very highest ranked phrases in the list." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:157	By contrast, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) evaluate the identification of phrasal terms without grammatical filtering on a 6.7 million word extract from the TREC databases, applying both WordNet and online dictionaries as gold standards." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:157	Once again, the general level of performance was low, with precision falling off rapidly as larger portions 605 of the n-best list were included, but they report better performance with statistical and information theoretic measures (including mutual information) than with frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:157	The overall pattern appears to be one where lexical association measures in general have very low precision and recall on unfiltered data, but perform far better when combined with other features which select linguistic patterns likely to function as phrasal terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:157	The relatively low precision of lexical association measures on unfiltered data no doubt has multiple explanations, but a logical candidate is the failure or inappropriacy of underlying statistical assumptions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:157	For instance, many of the tests assume a normal distribution, despite the highly skewed nature of natural language frequency distributions, though this is not the most important consideration except at very low n (cf.Moore 2004, Evert 2004, ch." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:157	4)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:157	More importantly, statistical and information-based metrics such as the log-likelihood and mutual information measure significance or informativeness relative to the assumption that the selection of component terms is statistically independent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:157	But of course the possibilities for combinations of words are anything but random and independent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:157	Use of linguistic filters such as 'attributive adjective followed by noun' or 'verb plus modifying prepositional phrase' arguably has the effect of selecting a subset of the language for which the standard null hypothesis -that any word may freely be combined with any other word -may be much more accurate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:157	Additionally, many of the association measures are defined only for bigrams, and do not generalize well to phrasal terms of varying length." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:157	The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the identification of candidate phrasal terms can be improved by adopting a heuristic which seeks to take certain of these statistical issues into account." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:157	The method to be presented here, the mutual rank ratio, is a nonparametric rank-based approach which appears to perform significantly better than the standard association metrics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:157	The body of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 will introduce the statistical considerations which provide a rationale for the mutual rank ratio heuristic and outline how it is calculated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:157	Section 3 will present the data sources and evaluation methodologies applied in the rest of the paper." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:157	Section 4 will evaluate the mutual rank ratio statistic and several other lexical association measures on a larger corpus than has been used in previous evaluations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:157	As will be shown below, the mutual rank ratio statistic recognizes phrasal terms more effectively than standard statistical measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:157	2 Statistical considerations 2.1 Highly skewed distributions As first observed e.g. by Zipf (1935, 1949) the frequency of words and other linguistic units tend to follow highly skewed distributions in which there are a large number of rare events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:157	Zipf's formulation of this relationship for single word frequency distributions (Zipf's first law) postulates that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency distribution, or more generally if we rank words by frequency and assign rank z, where the function fz(z,N) gives the frequency of rank z for a sample of size N, Zipf's first law states that: fz(z,N) = Cz where C is a normalizing constant and is a free parameter that determines the exact degree of skew; typically with single word frequency data, approximates 1 (Baayen 2001: 14)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:157	Ideally, an association metric would be designed to maximize its statistical validity with respect to the distribution which underlies natural language text -which is if not a pure Zipfian distribution at least an LNRE (large number of rare events, cf.Baayen 2001) distribution with a very long tail, containing events which differ in probability by many orders of magnitude." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:157	Unfortunately, research on LNRE distributions focuses primarily on unigram distributions, and generalizations to bigram and ngram distributions on large corpora are not as yet clearly feasible (Baayen 2001:221)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:157	Yet many of the best-performing lexical association measures, such as the t-test, assume normal distributions, (cf.Dunning 1993) or else (as with mutual information) eschew significance testing in favor of a generic information-theoretic approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:157	Various strategies could be adopted in this situation: finding a better model of the distribution,or adopting a nonparametric method." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:157	2.2 The independence assumption Even more importantly, many of the standard lexical association measures measure significance (or information content) against the default assumption that word-choices are statistically independent events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:157	This assumption is built into the highest-performing measures as observed in Evert & Krenn 2001, Krenn & Evert 2001 and Schone & Jurafsky 2001." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:157	This is of course untrue, and justifiable only as a simplifying idealization in the absence of a better model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:157	The actual probability of any sequence of words is strongly influenced by the base grammatical and semantic structure of language, particularly since phrasal terms usually conform to 606 the normal rules of linguistic structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:157	What makes a compound noun, or a verb-particle construction, into a phrasal term is not deviation from the base grammatical pattern for noun-noun or verb-particle structures, but rather a further pattern (of meaning and usage and thus heightened frequency) superimposed on the normal linguistic base." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:157	There are, of course, entirely aberrant phrasal terms, but they constitute the exception rather than the rule." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:157	This state of affairs poses something of a chicken-and-the-egg problem, in that statistical parsing models have to estimate probabilities from the same base data as the lexical association measures, so the usual heuristic solution as noted above is to impose a linguistic filter on the data, with the association measures being applied only to the subset thus selected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:157	The result is in effect a constrained statistical model in which the independence assumption is much more accurate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:157	For instance, if the universe of statistical possibilities is restricted to the set of sequences in which an adjective is followed by a noun, the null hypothesis that word choice is independent -i.e., that any adjective may precede any noun -is a reasonable idealization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:157	Without filtering, the independence assumption yields the much less plausible null hypothesis that any word may appear in any order." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:157	It is thus worth considering whether there are any ways to bring additional information to bear on the problem of recognizing phrasal terms without presupposing statistical independence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:157	2.3 Variable length; alternative/overlapping phrases Phrasal terms vary in length." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:157	Typically they range from about two to six words in length, but critically we cannot judge whether a phrase is lexical without considering both shorter and longer sequences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:157	That is, the statistical comparison that needs to be made must apply in principle to the entire set of word sequences that must be distinguished from phrasal terms, including longer sequences, subsequences, and overlapping sequences, despite the fact that these are not statistically independent events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:157	Of the association metrics mentioned thus far, only the C-Value method attempts to take direct notice of such word sequence information, and then only as a modification to the basic information provided by frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:157	Any solution to the problem of variable length must enable normalization allowing direct comparison of phrases of different length." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:157	Ideally, the solution would also address the other issues -the independence assumption and the skewed distributions typical of natural language data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:157	2.4 Mutual expectation An interesting proposal which seeks to overcome the variable-length issue is the mutual expectation metric presented in Dias, Guillor, and Lopes (1999) and implemented in the SENTA system (Gil and Dias 2003a)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:157	In their approach, the frequency of a phrase is normalized by taking into account the relative probability of each word compared to the phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:157	Dias, Guillor, and Lopes take as the foundation of their approach the idea that the cohesiveness of a text unit can be measured by measuring how strongly it resists the loss of any component term." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="73:157	That is, to the extent that phrasal terms follow the regular patterns of the language, a phrase might have a relatively low conditional probability (given the wide range of alternative phrases following the same basic linguistic patterns) and thus have a low mutual expectation yet still occur far more often than one would expect from chance." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="80:157	Since we do not know what the expected shape of this distribution is going to be, a nonparametric method using ranks is in order, and there is some reason to think that frequency rank regardless of n-gram size will be useful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:157	In particular, Ha, Sicilia-Garcia, Ming and Smith (2002) show that Zipf's law can be extended to the combined frequency distribution of n-grams of varying length up to rank 6, which entails that the relative rank of words in such a combined distribution provide a useful estimate of relative probability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:157	The availability of new techniques for handling large sets of n-gram data (e.g. Gil & Dias 2003b) make this a relatively feasible task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:157	Thus, given a phrase like east end, we can rank how often __ end appears with east in comparison to how often other phrases appear with east.That is, if {__ end, __side, the __, toward the __, etc.} is the set of (variable length) n-gram contexts associated with east (up to a length cutoff), then the actual rank of __ end is the rank we calculate by ordering all contexts by the frequency with which the actual word appears in the context." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="88:157	A few notes about the details of the method are in order." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:157	Actual ranks are assigned by listing all the contexts associated with each word in the corpus, and then ranking contexts by word, assigning the most frequent context for word n the rank 1, next next most frequent rank 2, etc. Tied ranks are given the median value for the ranks occupied by the tie, e.g., if two contexts with the same frequency would occupy ranks 2 and 3, they are both assigned rank 2.5." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="28:202	In fact, I find that this is a key aspect of teaching an applied class: learning what is possible with existing tools, what is feasible but requires more expertise than can be engineered in a semester with existing tools, and what is beyond the scope of current techniques." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:202	3 Choosing Tools and Readings The main challenges for a hands-on course as Id envisioned surrounded finding usable interoperable tools, and defining feasible assignments that make use of programming without letting it interfere with learning." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:202	There is of course the inevitable decision of which programming language(s) to work with." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:202	Scripting tools such as python are fast and easy to prototype with, but require the students to learn a new programming language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:202	Java is attractive because many tools are written in it and the MIMS students were familiar with java  they are required to use it for two of their required courses but still tend to struggle with it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:202	I did not consider perl since python is a more principled language and is growing in acceptance and in tool availability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:202	In the end I decided to require the students to learn python because I wanted to use NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit (Loper and Bird, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:202	One goal of NLTK is to remove the emphasis on programming to enable students to achieve results quickly; and this aligned with my primary goal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:202	NLTK seemed promising because it contained some well-written tutorials on n-grams, POS tagging and chunking, and contained text categorization modules." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:202	(I also wanted support for entity extraction, which NLTK does not supply)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:202	NLTK is written in python, and so I decided to try it and have the students learn a new programming language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:202	As will be described in detail below, our use of NLTK was somewhat successful, but we experienced numerous problems as well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:202	I made a rather large mistake early on by not spending time introducing python, since I wanted the assignments to correspond to the lectures and did not want to spend lecture time on the programming language itself." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:202	I instructed students who had registered for the course to learn python during the summer, but (not surprisingly) many of did not and had to struggle in the first few weeks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:202	In retrospect, I realize I should have allowed time for people to learn python, perhaps via a lab session that met only during the first few weeks of class." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:202	Another sticking point was student exposure to regular expressions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:202	Regexs were very important and useful practical tools both for tokenization assignments and for shallow parsing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:202	I assumed that the MIMS students had gotten practice with regular expressions because they are required to take a computer concepts foundations course which I designed several years ago." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:202	Unfortunately, the lecturer who took over the class from me had decided to omit regexs and related topics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:202	I realized that I had to do some remedial coverage of the topic, which of course bored the CS students and which was not complete enough for the MIMS students." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:202	Again this suggests that perhaps some kind of lab is needed for getting people caught up in topics, or that perhaps 2 the first few weeks of the class should be optional for more advanced students." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:202	I was also unable to find an appropriate textbook." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:202	Neither Schutze & Manning nor Jurafsky & Martin focus on the right topics." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="52:202	Instead of a text, students read a small selection of research papers and the NLTK tutorials." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:202	4 Topics The course met twice weekly for 80 minute periods." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="55:202	Course Introduction Using Large Collections (intro to NLTK) Tokenization, Morphological Analysis Part-of-Speech Tagging Conditional Probabilities Shallow Parsing (2) Text Classification: Introduction Text Classification: Feature Selection Text Classification: Algorithms Text Classification: Using Weka Information Extraction (2) Email and Anti-Spam Analysis Text Data Mining Lexicons and Ontologies FrameNet (guest lecture by Chuck Fillmore) Enron email dataset (in-class work) (2) Spelling Correction / Clustering Summarization (guest lecture by Drago Radev) Question Answering (2) Machine Translation (slides by Kevin Knight) Topic Segmentation / Discourse Processing Class Presentations Note the lack of coverage of full syntactic parsing, which is covered extensively in Dan Kleins course." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:202	I touched on it briefly in the second shallow parsing lecture and felt this level of coverage was acceptable because shallow parsing is often as useful if not more so than full parsing for most applications." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:202	Note also the lack of coverage of word sense disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:202	This topic is rich in algorithms, but was omitted primarily due to time constraints, but in part because of the lack of well-known applications." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:202	Based on the kinds of capstone projects the MIMS students have done in the past, I knew that the most important techniques for their needs surrounded text categorization and information extraction/entity recognition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:202	There are terrific software resources for text categorization and the field is fairly mature, so I had my PhD students Preslav Nakov and Barbara Rosario gave the lectures on this topic, in order to provide them with teaching experience." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:202	The functionality provided by named entity recognition is very important for a wide range of real-world applications." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:202	Unfortunately, none of the free tools that we tried were particularly successful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:202	Those that are available are difficult to configure and get running in a short amount of time, and have virtually no documentation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:202	Furthermore, the state-ofthe-art in algorithms is not present in the available tools in the way that more mature technologies such as POS tagging, parsing, and categorization are." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:202	5 Using NLTK 5.1 Benefits We used the latest version of NLTK, which at the time was version 1.4.2 NLTK supplies some preprocessed text collections, which are quite useful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:202	(Unfortunately, the different corpora have different types of preprocessing applied to them, which often lead to confusion and extra work for the class.)" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:202	The NLTK tokenizer, POS taggers and the shallow parser (chunker) have terrific functionality once they are understood; some students were able to get quite accurate results using these and the supplied training sets." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:202	The ability to combine different n-gram taggers within the structure of a backoff tagger also supported an excellent exercise." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:202	However, a somewhat minor problem with the taggers is that there is no compact way to store the model resulting from tagging for later use." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:202	A serialized object could be created and stored, but the size of such object was so large that it takes about as long to load it into memory as it does to retrain the tagger." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:202	2http://nltk.sourceforge.org 3 5.2 Drawbacks There were four major problems with NLTK from the perspective of this course." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:202	The first major problem was the inconsistency in the different releases of code, both in terms of incompatibilities between the data structures in the different versions, and incompatibility of the documentation and tutorials within the different versions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:202	It was tricky to determine which documentation was associated with which code version." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:202	And much of the contributed code did not work with the current version." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:202	The second major problem was related to the first, but threw a major wrench into our plans: some of the advertised functionality simply was not available in the current version of the software." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:202	Notably, NLTK advertised a text categorization module; without this I would not have adopted NLTK as the coding platform for the class." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:202	Unfortunately, the most current version did not in fact support categorization, and we discovered this just days before we were to begin covering this topic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:202	The third major problem was the incompleteness of the documentation for much of the code." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:202	This to some degree undermined the goal of reducing the amount of work for students, since they (and I) had to struggle to figure out what was going on in the code and data structures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:202	One of these documentation problems centered around the data structure for conditional probabilities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:202	NLTK creates a FreqDist class which is explained well in the documentation (it records a count for each occurrence of some phenomenon, much like a hash table) and provides methods for retrieving the max, the count and frequency of each occurrence, and so on." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:202	It also provides a class called a CondFreqDist, but does not document its methods nor explain its implementation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:202	Users have to scrutinize the examples given and try to reverse engineer the data structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:202	Eventually I realized that it is simply a list of objects of type FreqDist, but this was difficult to determine at first, and caused much wasting of time and confusion among the students." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:202	There is also confusion surrounding the use of the method names count and frequency for FreqDist." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:202	Count refers to number of occurrences and frequency to a probability distribution across items, but this distinction is never stated explicitly although it can be inferred from a table of methods in the tutorial." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:202	A less dramatic but still hampering problem was with the design of the core data structures, which make use of attribute tags rather than classes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:202	This leads to rather awkward code structures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:202	For example, after a sentence is tokenized, the results of tokenization are appended to the sentence data structure and are accessed via use of a subtoken keyword such as TOKENS." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:202	To then run a POS tagger over the tokenized results, the TOKENS keyword has to be specified as the value for a SUBTOKENS attribute, and another keyword must be supplied to act as the name of the tagged results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:202	In my opinion it would be better to use the class system and define objects of different types and operations on those objects." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:202	6 Assignments One of the major goals of the class was for the students to obtain hands-on experience using and extending existing NLP tools." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:202	This was accomplished through a series of homework assignments and a final project." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:202	My pedagogical philosophy surrounding assignments is to supply as much as the functionality as necessary so that the coding that students do leads directly to learning." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:202	Thus, I try to avoid making students deal with details of formatting files and so on." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:202	I also try to give students a starting point to build up on." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:202	The first assignment made use of some exercises from the NLTK tutorials." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:202	Students completed tokenizing exercises which required the use of the NLTK corpus tool accessors and the FreqDist and CondFreqDist classes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:202	They also did POS tagging exercises which exposed them to the idea of ngrams, backoff algorithms, and to the process of training and testing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:202	This assignment was challenging (especially because of some misleading text in the tagging tutorial, which has since been fixed) but the students learned a great deal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:202	As mentioned above, I should have begun with a preliminary assignment which got students familiar with python basics before attempting this assignment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:202	For assignment 2, I provided a simple set of regular expression grammar rules for the shallow parser class, and asked the students to improve on these." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="103:202	After building the chunker, students were asked to 4 choose a verb and then analyze verb-argument structure (they were provided with two relevant papers (Church and Hanks, 1990; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:202	As mentioned above, most of the MIMS students were not familiar with regular expressions, so I should have done a longer unit on this topic, at the expense of boring the CS students." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:202	The students learned a great deal from working to improve the grammar rules, but the verb-argument analysis portion was not particularly successful, in part because the corpus analyzed was too small to yield many sentences for a given verb and because we did not have code to automatically find regularities about the semantics of the arguments of the verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:202	Other causes of difficulty were the students lack of linguistic background, and the fact that the chunking part took longer than I expected, leaving students little time for the analysis portion of the assignment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:202	Assignments 3 and 4 are described in the following subsections." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:202	6.1 Text Categorization Assignment As mentioned above, text categorization is useful for a wide range SIMS applications, and we made it a centerpiece of the course." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:202	Unfortunately, we had to make a mid-course correction when I suddenly realized that text categorization was no longer available in NLTK." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:202	After looking at a number of tools, we decided to use the Weka toolkit for categorization (Witten and Frank, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:202	We did not want the students to feel they had wasted their time learning python and NLTK, so we decided to make it easy for the students to reuse their python code by providing an interface between it and Weka." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:202	My PhD student Preslav Nakov provided great help by writing code to translate the output of our python code into the input format expected by Weka." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:202	(Weka is written in java but has command line and GUI interfaces, and can read in input files and store models as output files)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="114:202	As time went on we added increasingly more functionality to this code, tying it in with the NLTK modules so that the students could use the NLTK corpora for training and testing.3 3Available at http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is2902/f04/assignments/assignment3.html Both Preslav and I had used Weka in the past but mainly with the command-line interface, and not taking advantage of its rich functionality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="115:202	As with NLTK, the documentation for Weka was incomplete and out of date, and it was difficult to determine how to use the more advanced features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="116:202	We performed extended experimentation with the system and developed a detailed tutorial on how to use the system; this tutorial should be of general use.4 For the categorization task, we used the twenty newsgroups collection that was supplied with NLTK." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="117:202	Unfortunately, it was not preprocessed into sentences, so I also had to write some sentence splitting code (based on Palmer and Hearst (1997)) so students could make use of their tokenizer and tagger code." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="118:202	We selected one pair of newsgroups which contained very different content (rec.motorcycles vs. sci.space)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="119:202	We called this the diverse set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="120:202	We then created two groups of newsgroups with more homogeneous content (a) rec.autos, rec.motorcycles, rec.sport.baseball, rec.sport.hockey, and (b) sci.crypt, sci.electronics, sci.med.original, sci.space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:202	The intention was to show the students that it is easier to automatically distinguish the heterogeneous groups than the homogeneous ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:202	We set up the code to allow students to adjust the size of their training and development sets, and to separate out a reserved test set that would be used for comparing students solutions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="123:202	We challenged the students to get the best scores possible on the held out test set, telling them not to use this test set until they were completely finished training and testing on the development set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="124:202	(We relied on the honor system for this)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="125:202	We made it known that we would announce which were the top-scoring assignments." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="126:202	As a general rule I avoid competition in my classes, but this was kept very low-key; only the top-scoring results would be named." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="127:202	Furthermore, innovative approaches that perhaps did not do as well as some others were also highlighted." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="128:202	Students were required to try at least 2 different types of features and 3 different classifiers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="129:202	This assignment was quite successful, as the stu4Available at http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is2902/f04/lectures/lecture11.ppt 5 dents were creative about building their features, and it was possible to achieve very strong results (much stronger than I expected) on both sets of newsgroups." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="130:202	The best scoring approaches got 99% accuracy on the 2-way diverse distinction and 97% accuracy on the 4-way homogeneous distinction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="131:202	6.2 Enron Email Assignment Many of the SIMS students are interested in social networking and related topics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="132:202	I decided as part of the class that we would analyze a relatively new text collection that had become available and that contained the potential for interesting text mining and analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="133:202	I was also interested in having the class help produce a resource that would be of use to other classes and researchers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="134:202	Thus we decided to take on the Enron email corpus,5 on which limited analysis had been done." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="135:202	My PhD student Andrew Fiore wrote code to preprocess this text, removing redundancies, normalizing email addresses, labeling quoted text, and so on." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="136:202	He and I designed a database schema for representing much of the structure of the collection and loaded in the parsed text." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="138:202	Andrews system eventually allowed for individual students to login and register annotations on the email messages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="139:202	This collection consists of approximately 200,000 messages after the duplicates have been removed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="140:202	We wanted to identify a subset of emails that might be interesting for analysis while at the same time avoiding highly personal messages, messages consisting mainly of jokes, and so on." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="141:202	After doing numerous searches, we decided to try to focus primarily on documents relating to the California energy crisis, trading discrepancies, and messages occurring near the end of the time range (just before the companys stock crashed)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="142:202	After selecting about 1500 messages, I devised an initial set of categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="143:202	In class we refined these." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="144:202	One student had the interesting idea of trying to identify change in emotional tone as the scandals surrounding the company came to light, so we added emotional tone as a category type." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="145:202	Each message 5http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/ enron/ 6http://lucene.apache.org was then read and annotated by two students using the pre-defined categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="146:202	Students were asked to reconcile their differences when they had them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="147:202	Despite these safeguards, my impression is that the resulting assignments are far from consistent and the categories themselves are still rather ad hoc and oftentimes overlapping." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="148:202	There were many difficult curation issues, such as how to categorize a message with forwarded content when that content differed in kind from the new material." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="149:202	If wed spent more time on this we could have done a better job, but as this was not an information organization course, I felt we could not spend more time on perfecting the labels." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="150:202	Thus, I do not recommend the category labels be used for serious analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="151:202	Nevertheless, a number of researchers have asked for the cleaned up database and categories, and we have made them publicly available, along with the search interface.7 The students were then given two weeks to process the collection in some manner." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="152:202	I made several suggestions, including trying to automatically assign the hand-assigned categories, extending some automatic acronym recognition work that wed done in our research (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003), using named entity recognition code to identify various actors, clustering the collection, or doing some kind of social network analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="153:202	Students were told that they could extend this assignment into their final projects if they chose." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="154:202	For most students it was difficult to obtain a strong result using this collection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="155:202	The significant exception was for those students who worked on extending our acronym recognition algorithm; these projects were quite successful." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="160:202	I was a bit worried about students trying to use clustering to analyze the results, given the general difficulty of making sense of the results of cluster7http://bailando.sims.berkeley.edu/enron email.html 8http://mallet.cs.umass.edu 6 ing, and this concern was justified." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="161:202	Clustering based on Weka and other tools is of course memoryand compute-intensive, but more problematically, the results are difficult to interpret." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:169	We will also present preliminary work of how a subset of such associations, for example, topical associations, can be acquired by filtering a network of lexical co-occurrences extracted from a corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:169	1 Introduction A dictionary user typically pursues one of two goals (Humble, 2001): as a decoder (reading, listening), he may look for the definition or the translation of a specific target word, while as an encoder (speaker, writer) he may want to find a word that expresses well not only a given concept, but is also appropriate in a given context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:169	Obviously, readers and writers come to the dictionary with different mindsets, information and expectations concerning input and output." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:169	While the decoder can provide the word he wants additional information for, the encoder (language producer) provides the meaning of a word for which he lacks the corresponding form." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:169	In sum, users with different goals need access to different indexes, one that is based on form (decoding), 1 In alphabetical order the other being based on meaning or meaning relations (encoding)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:169	Our concern here is more with the encoder, i.e. lexical access in language production, a feature largely neglected in lexicographical work." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:169	Yet, a good dictionary contains not only many entries and a lot of information concerning each one of them, but also efficient means to reveal the stored information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:169	Because, what is a huge dictionary good for, if one cannot access the information it contains?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:169	2 Lexical access on the basis of what: concepts (i.e. meanings) or words?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:169	Broadly speaking, there are two views concerning lexicalization: the process is conceptuallydriven (meaning, or parts of it are the starting point) or lexically-driven 2 : the target word is accessed via a source word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:169	This is typically the case when we are looking for a synonym, antonym, hypernym (paradigmatic associations), or any of its syntagmatic associates (red-rose, coffee-black), the kind of association we will be concerned with here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:169	Yet, besides conceptual knowledge, people seem also to know a lot of things concerning the lexical form (Brown and Mc Neill, 1966): number of syllables, beginning/ending of the target word, part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), origin (Greek or Latin), gender (Vigliocco et al. , 2 Of course, the input can also be hybrid, that is, it can be composed of a conceptual and a linguistic component." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:169	For example, in order to express the notion of intensity, MAGN in MelAuks theory (MelAuk et al. , 1995), a speaker or writer has to use different words (very, seriously, high) depending on the form of the argument (ill, wounded, price), as he says very ill, seriously wounded, high price." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="23:169	While in principle, all this information could be used to constrain the search space, we will deal here only with one aspect, the words relations to other concepts or words (associative knowledge)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:169	Suppose, you were looking for a word expressing the following ideas: domesticated animal, producing milk suitable for making cheese." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:169	Suppose further that you knew that the target word was neither cow, buffalo nor sheep." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:169	While none of this information is sufficient to guarantee the access of the intended word goat, the information at hand (part of the definition) could certainly be used 3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:169	Besides this type of information, people often have other kinds of knowledge concerning the target word." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="12:185	Very often, this task is realised by indexing the documents in the collection with keyword descriptors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:185	Retrieval consists in matching the query against the descriptors of the documents, and returning the ones that appear closest, in ranked lists of relevance (van Rijsbergen, 1979)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:185	Usually, the keywords that constitute the document descriptors are associated with individual weights, which capture the importance of the keywords to the content of the document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:185	Such weights, commonly referred to as term weights, can be computed using various term weighting schemes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:185	Not all words can be used as keyword descriptors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:185	In fact, a relatively small number of words accounts for most of a documents content (van Rijsbergen, 1979)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:185	This is practically realised with the use of stopword lists, which are lists of words to be exempted when indexing the collection and the queries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:185	The use of stopword lists in IR is a manifestation of a well-known bifurcation in linguistics between open and closed classes of words (Lyons, 1977)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:185	In brief, open class words are more content-bearing than closed class words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="9:234	Word sense disambiguation models often work with a notion of similarity among the contexts within which word (senses) appear, and MT identifies candidate lexical translation equivalents via a comparable measure of similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:234	Many learning algorithms currently popular in CL, including not only supervised techniques such as memorybased learning (k-nn) and support-vector machines, but also unsupervised techniques such as Kohonen maps and clustering, rely essentially on measures of similarity for their processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:234	Notions of similarity are often invoked in linguistic areas such as dialectology, historical linguistics, stylometry, second-language learning (as a measure of learners proficiency), psycholinguistics (accounting for lexical neighborhood effects, where neighborhoods are defined by similarity) and even in theoretical linguistics (novel accounts of the phonological constraints on semitic roots)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="13:234	We assume that there is always a hidden variable in the similarity relation, so that we should always speak of similarity with respect to some property, and we suspect that there is such a plethora of measures in part because researchers are often inexplicit on this point." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:234	2 Pronunciation John Laver, the author of the most widely used textbook in phonetics, claimed that one of the 1 most basic concepts in phonetics, and one of the least discussed, is that of phonetic similarity [boldface in original, JN & EH] (Laver, 1994, p. 391), justifying the attention the workshop pays to it." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="48:234	LANGUAGE CONTACT studies seek to identify the elements of one language which have been adopted in a second in a situation in which two or more languages are used in the same community (Thomason and Kaufmann, 1988; van Coetsem, 1988)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:234	Naturally, these may be non-syntactic, but syntactic CONTAMINATION is a central concept which is recognized in contaminated varieties which have become more similar to the languages which are the source of contamination." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="53:234	They approach issues of statistical significance using permutation tests, which requires attention to tricky issues of normalization between the frequency distributions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:234	Homola & Kubon (this volume) join Nerbonne and Wiersma in advocating a surface-oriented measure of syntactic difference, but base their measure on dependency trees rather than POS tags, a more abstract level of analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:234	From there they propose an analogue to edit distance to gauge the degree of difference." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:234	The difference between two tree is the sum of the costs of the tree-editing operations needed to obtain one tree from another (Noetzel and Selkow, 1999)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:234	4 Semantics While similarity as such has not been a prominent term in theoretical and computational research on natural language semantics, the study of LEXICAL SEMANTICS, which attempts to identify regularities of and systematic relations among word meanings, is more often than not predicated on an implicit notion of semantic similarity." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="65:234	In logic-based theories of word meaning (e.g. , Vendler (1967) and Dowty (1979)), verb classes are identified by similarity patterns of inference, while Levins (1993) study of English verb classes demonstrates that similarities of word meanings for verbs can be gleaned from their syntactic behavior, in particular from their ability or inability to participate in diatheses, i.e. patterns of argument alternations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:234	With the increasing availability of large electronic corpora, recent computational research on word meaning has focused on capturing the notion of context similarity of words." ></td>

Firth: You shall know a word by the company it keeps.

	<td class="line x" title="4:219	We show that the newly proposed concept-distance measures outperform traditional distributional word-distance measures in the tasks of (1) ranking word pairs in order of semantic distance, and (2) correcting realword spelling errors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:219	In the latter task, of all the WordNet-based measures, only that proposed by Jiang and Conrath outperforms the best distributional conceptdistance measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:219	1 Semantic and distributional measures Measures of distance of meaning are of two kinds." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:219	The first kind, which we will refer to as semantic measures, rely on the structure of a resource such as WordNet or, in some cases, a semantic network, and hence they measure the distance between the concepts or word-senses that the nodes of the resource represent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:219	Examples include the measure for MeSH proposed by Rada et al.(1989) and those for WordNet proposed by Leacock and Chodorow (1998) and Jiang and Conrath (1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:219	(Some of the more successful measures, such as JiangConrath, also use information content derived from word frequency)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:219	Typically, these measures rely on an extensive hierarchy of hyponymy relationships for nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:219	Therefore, these measures are expected to perform poorly when used to estimate distance between senses of part-of-speech pairs other than nounnoun, not just because the WordNet hierarchies for other parts of speech are less well developed, but also because the hierarchies for the different parts of speech are not well connected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:219	The second kind of measures, which we will refer to as distributional measures, are inspired by the maxim You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, 1957)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:219	These measures rely simply on raw text, and hence are much less resource-hungry than the semantic measures; but they measure the distance between words rather than word-senses or concepts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:219	In these measures, two words are considered close if they occur in similar contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:219	The context (or company) of a target word is represented by its distributional profile (DP), which lists the strength of association between the target and each of the lexical, syntactic, and/or semantic units that co-occur with it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:219	Commonly used measures of strength of association are conditional probability (0 to 1) and pointwise mutual information (A0 to ) 1 .Commonly used units of co-occurrence with the target are other words, and so we speak of the lexical distributional profile of a word (lexical DPW).The co-occurring words may be all those in a predetermined window around the target, or may be restricted to those that have a certain syntactic (e.g. , verbobject) or semantic (e.g. , agenttheme) relation with the target word." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="30:219	While any of the measures of DP distance may be used with any of the measures of strength of association (see Table 1), in practice -skew divergence (ASD), cosine, and JensenShannon divergence (JSD) are used with conditional probability (CP), whereas Lin is used with PMI, resulting in the distributional measures ASD cp (Lee, 2001), Cos cp (Schutze and Pedersen, 1997), JSD cp,andLin pmi (Lin, 1998), respectively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:219	ASD cp is a modification of Kullback-Leibler divergence that overcomes the latters problem of division by zero, which can be caused by data sparseness." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:219	2 The distributional hypothesis and its limitations The distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957) states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to be semantically similar." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:219	It is often suggested, therefore, that a distributional measure can act as a proxy for a semantic measure: the distance between the DPs of words will approximate the distance between their senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:219	But when words have more than one sense, it is not at all clear what semantic distance between them actually means." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:219	A word in each of its senses is likely to co-occur with different sets of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:219	For example, bank in the financial institution sense is likely to cooccur with interest, money, accounts, andsoon, whereas the river bank sense might have words such as river, erosion, and silt around it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:219	If we define the distance between two words, at least one of which is ambiguous, to be the closest distance between some sense of one and some sense of the other, then distributional distance between words may indeed be used in place of semantic distance between concepts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:219	However, because measures of distributional distance depend on occurrences of the target word in all its senses, this substitution is inaccurate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:219	For example, observe that both DPWs of pulse above have words that co-occur with its throbbing arteries sense and words that co-occur with its edible seed sense." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:219	Relation-free DPs of pulse in its two separate senses might be as follows: pulse throbbing arteries: beat (.36), racing (.27), heart (.11), . . ." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:219	pulse edible seeds: grow (.24), beans (.14), . . ." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:219	Thus, it is clear that different senses of a word have different distributional profiles (different company)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:219	Using a single DP for the word will mean the union of those profiles." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:219	While this might be useful for certain applications, we believe that in a number of tasks (including estimating linguistic distance), acquiring different DPs for the different senses is not only more intuitive, but also, as we will show through experiments in Section 5, more useful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:219	We argue that distributional profiles of senses or concepts (DPCs) can be used to infer semantic properties of the senses: You shall know a sense by the company it keeps. 36 3 Conceptual grain size and storage requirements As applications for linguistic distance become more sophisticated and demanding, it becomes attractive to pre-compute and store the distance values between all possible pairs of words or senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:219	But both kinds of measures have large space requirements to do this, requiring matrices of size N A2N,whereN is the size of the vocabulary (perhaps 100,000 for most languages) in the case of distributional measures and the number of senses (75,000 just for nouns in WordNet) in the case of semantic measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:219	It is generally accepted, however, that WordNet senses are far too fine-grained (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle Lekuona (2003) and citations therein)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:219	On the other hand, published thesauri, such as Rogets and Macquarie, group near-synonymous and semantically related words into a relatively small number of categoriestypically between 800 and 1100that roughly correspond to very coarse concepts or senses (Yarowsky, 1992)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:219	Words with more than one sense are listed in more than one category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:219	A published thesaurus thus provides us with a very coarse human-developed set or inventory of word senses or concepts 2 that are more intuitive and discernible than the concepts generated by dimensionality-reduction methods such as latent semantic analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:219	Using coarse senses from a known inventory means that the senses can be represented unambiguously by a large number of possibly ambiguous words (conveniently available in the thesaurus)a feature that we exploited in our earlier work (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006) to determine useful estimates of the strength of association between a concept and co-occurring words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:219	In this paper, we go one step further and use the idea of a very coarse sense inventory to develop a framework for distributional measures of concepts that can more naturally and more accurately be used in place of semantic measures of word senses." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="65:219	Determining lexical DPWs simply involves making wordword co-occurrence counts in a corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:219	A direct method to determine lexical DPCs, on the other hand, requires information about which words occur with which concepts." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:147	1 Introduction Information Extraction (IE) is a natural language processing task in which text documents are analyzed with the aim of finding mentions of relevant entities and important relationships between them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:147	In many cases, the subtask of relation extraction reduces to deciding whether a sentence asserts a particular relationship between two entities, which is still a difficult, unsolved problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:147	There are however cases where the decision whether the two entities are in a relationship is made relative to an entire document, or a collection of documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:147	In the biomedical domain, for example, one may be interested in finding the pairs of human proteins that are said to be interacting in any of the Medline abstracts, where the answer is not required to specify which abstracts are actually describing the interaction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:147	Assembling a ranked list of interacting proteins can be very useful to biologists based on this list, they can make more informed decisions with respect to which genes to focus on in their research." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:147	In this paper, we investigate methods that use multiple occurrences of the same pair of entities across a collection of documents in order to boost the performance of a relation extraction system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:147	The proposed methods are evaluated on the task of finding pairs of human proteins whose interactions are reported in Medline abstracts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:147	The majority of known human protein interactions are derived from individual, small-scale experiments reported in Medline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:147	Some of these interactions have already been collected in the Reactome (Joshi-Tope et al. , 2005), BIND (Bader et al. , 2003), DIP (Xenarios et al. , 2002), and HPRD (Peri et al. , 2004) databases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:147	The amount of human effort involved in creating and updating these databases is currently no match for the continuous growth of Medline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:147	It is therefore very useful to have a method that automatically and reliably extracts interaction pairs from Medline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:147	Systems that do relation extraction from a collection of documents can be divided into two major categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:147	In one category are IE systems that first extract information from individual sentences, and then combine the results into corpuslevel results (Craven, 1999; Skounakis and Craven, 2003)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:147	The second category corresponds to approaches that do not exploit much information from the context of individual occurrences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:147	Instead, based on co-occurrence counts, various statistical 49 or information-theoretic tests are used to decide whether the two entities in a pair appear together more often than simple chance would predict (Lee et al. , 2004; Ramani et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:147	We believe that a combination of the two approaches can inherit the advantages of each method and lead to improved relation extraction accuracy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:147	The following two sections describe the two orthogonal approaches to corpus-level relation extraction." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="24:147	This is followed by a description of the dataset used for evaluation in Section 5, and experimental results in Section 6." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:147	2 Sentence-level relation extraction Most systems that identify relations between entities mentioned in text documents consider only pair of entities that are mentioned in the same sentence (Ray and Craven, 2001; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:147	To decide the existence and the type of a relationship, these systems generally use lexico-semantic clues inferred from the sentence context of the two entities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:147	Much research has been focused recently on automatically identifying biologically relevant entities and their relationships such as protein-protein interactions or subcellular localizations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:147	For example, the sentence TR6 specifically binds Fas ligand, states an interaction between the two proteins TR6 and Fas ligand." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:147	One of the first systems for extracting interactions between proteins is described in (Blaschke and Valencia, 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:147	There, sentences are matched deterministically against a set of manually developed patterns, where a pattern is a sequence of words or Partof-Speech (POS) tags and two protein-name tokens." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:147	Between every two adjacent words is a number indicating the maximum number of words that can be skipped at that position." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:147	An example is: interaction of (3) BOPBQ (3) with (3) BOPBQ." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:147	This approach is generalized in (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), where subsequences of words (or POS tags) from the sentence are used as implicit features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:147	Their weights are learned by training a customized subsequence kernel on a dataset of Medline abstracts annotated with proteins and their interactions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:147	A relation extraction system that works at the sentence-level and which outputs normalized confidence values for each extracted pair of entities can also be used for corpus-level relation extraction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:147	A straightforward way to do this is to apply an aggregation operator over the confidence values inferred for all occurrences of a given pair of entities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:147	More exactly, if D4 BD and D4 BE are two entities that occur in a total of D2 sentences D7 BD, D7 BE, , D7 D2 in the entire corpus BV, then the confidence C8B4CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5CYBVB5 that they are in a particular relationship CA is defined as: C8B4CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5CYBVB5 BP A0B4CUC8B4CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5CYD7 CX B5CYCXBPBDBMD2CVB5 Table 1 shows only four of the many possible choices for the aggregation operator A0." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="39:147	Out of the four operators in Table 1, we believe that the max operator is the most appropriate for aggregating confidence values at the corpus-level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:147	The question that needs to be answered is whether there is a sentence somewhere in the corpus that asserts the relationship CA between entities D4 BD and D4 BE . Using avg instead would answer a different question whether CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 is true in most of the sentences containing D4 BD and D4 BE . Also, the and operator would be most appropriate for finding whether CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 is true in all corresponding sentences in the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:147	The value of the noisy-or operator (Pearl, 1986) is too dependent on the number of occurrences, therefore it is less appropriate for a corpus where the occurrence counts vary from one entity pair to another (as confirmed in our experiments from Section 6)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:147	For examples, if the confidence threshold is set at BCBMBH, and the entity pair B4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 occurs in 6 sentences or less, each with confidence BCBMBD, then CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 is false, according to the noisy-or operator." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:147	However, if B4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 occur in more than 6 sentences, with the same confidence value of BCBMBD, then the corresponding noisy-or value exceeds BCBMBH, making CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 true." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:147	50 3 Co-occurrence statistics Given two entities with multiple mentions in a large corpus, another approach to detect whether a relationship holds between them is to use statistics over their occurrences in textual patterns that are indicative for that relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:147	Various measures such as pointwise mutual information (PMI), chi-square (AVBE) or log-likelihood ratio (LLR) (Manning and Schutze, 1999) use the two entities occurrence statistics to detect whether their co-occurrence is due to chance, or to an underlying relationship." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:147	A recent example is the co-citation approach from (Ramani et al. , 2005), which does not try to find specific assertions of interactions in text, but rather exploits the idea that if many different abstracts reference both protein D4 BD and protein D4 BE, then D4 BD and D4 BE are likely to interact." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:147	Particularly, if the two proteins are co-cited significantly more often than one would expect if they were cited independently at random, then it is likely that they interact." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:147	The model used to compute the probability of random co-citation is based on the hypergeometric distribution (Lee et al. , 2004; Jenssen et al. , 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:147	Thus, if C6 is the total number of abstracts, D2 of which cite the first protein, D1 cite the second protein, and CZ cite both, then the probability of co-citation under a random model is: C8B4CZCYC6BND1BND2B5 BP AI D2 CZ AJAI C6 A0D2 D1A0CZ AJ AI C6 D1 AJ (1) The approach that we take in this paper is to constrain the two proteins to be mentioned in the same sentence, based on the assumption that if there is a reason for two protein names to co-occur in the same sentence, then in most cases that is caused by their interaction." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="50:147	To compute the degree of interaction between two proteins D4 BD and D4 BE, we use the information-theoretic measure of pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990; Manning and Schutze, 1999), which is computed based on the following quantities: 1." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="59:147	D7C8C5C1B4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 BP D2 BDBE D2 BD A1 D2 BE (3) 4 Integrated model The D7C8C5C1B4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 formula can be rewritten as: D7C8C5C1B4D4 BD BND4 BE B5 BP BD D2 BD A1 D2 BE A1 D2 BDBE CG CXBPBD BD (4) Let D7 BD, D7 BE,  , D7 D2 BDBE be the sentence contexts corresponding to the D2 BDBE co-occurrences of D4 BD and D4 BE, and assume that a sentence-level relation extractor is available, with the capability of computing normalized confidence values for all extractions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:147	Then one way of using the extraction confidence is to have each co-occurrence weighted by its confidence, i.e. replace the constant BD with the normalized scores C8B4CAB4D4 BD BND4 BE B5CYD7 CX B5, as illustrated in Equation 5." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="14:203	Typically the phrases are putative multiwords and noncompositionality is viewed as an important feature of many such words with spaces (Sag et al. , 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:203	For applications such as paraphrasing, information extraction and translation, it is essential to take the words of non-compositional phrases together as a unit because the meaning of a phrase cannot be obtained straightforwardly from the constituent words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:203	In this work we are investigate methods of determining semantic compositionality of verb-object 1 combinations on a continuum following previous research in this direction (McCarthy et al. , 2003; Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:203	Much previous research has used a combination of statistics and distributional approaches whereby distributional similarity is used to compare the constituents of the multiword with the multiword itself." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="21:203	369 Selectional preferences of predicates have been modelled using the man-made thesaurus WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), see for example (Resnik, 1993; Li and Abe, 1998; Abney and Light, 1999; Clark and Weir, 2002)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="53:157	Formally, the unithood of any two lexical units ax and ay can be defined as Definition 1 The unithood of two lexical units is the degree of strength or stability of syntagmatic combinations and collocations (Kageura and Umino, 1996) between them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:157	It is obvious that the problem of measuring the unithood of any pair of words is the determination of their degree of collocational strength as mentioned in Definition 1." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="59:157	In addition, the size of ax and ay has no effect on the determination of their unithood using our approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:157	As we have discussed in Section 2, most of the conventional practices employ frequency of occurrence from local corpora, and some statistical tests or information-theoretic measures to determine the coupling strength between elements in W = {s,ax,ay}." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="62:157	It is inherent to the use of local corpora that can lead to poor estimation of parameters or weights; and  Assumption of independence and normality of word distribution are two of the many problems in language modelling (Franz, 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:157	While the independence assumption reduces text to simply a bag of words, the assumption of normal distribution of words will often lead to incorrect conclusions during statistical tests." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="65:157	As an attempt to address the first problem, we utilise page counts by Google for estimating the probability of occurrences of the lexical units in W. 105 We consider the World Wide Web as a large general corpus and the Google search engine as a gateway for accessing the documents in the general corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:157	Our choice of using Google to obtain the page count was merely motivated by its extensive coverage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:157	In fact, it is possible to employ any search engines on the World Wide Web for this research." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:157	As for the second issue, we attempt to address the problem of determining the degree of collocational strength in terms of probabilities estimated using Google page count." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="71:157	Function words such as a, is and with, as opposed to content words, appear with frequencies that are relatively stable over many different genres." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:157	Next, we perform random draws (i.e. trial) of documents from N. For each lexical unit w  W, there will be a corresponding set of outcomes (i.e. events) from the draw." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:157	There will be three basic sets which are of interest to us: Definition 2 Basic events corresponding to each w  W:  X is the event that ax occurs in the document  Y is the event that ay occurs in the document  S is the event that s occurs in the document It should be obvious to the readers that since the documents in S have to contain all two units ax and ay, S is a subset of X  Y or S  X  Y . It is worth noting that even though S  X  Y , it is highly unlikely that S = X  Y since the two portions ax and ay may exist in the same document without being conjoined by b. Next, subscribing to the frequency interpretation of probability, we can obtain the probability of the events in Definition 2 in terms of Google page count: P(X) = nx|N| (4) P(Y) = ny|N| P(S) = ns|N| where nx, ny and ns is the page count returned as the result of Google search using the term [+ax], [+ay] and [+s], respectively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:157	The pair of quotes that encapsulates the search terms is the phrase operator, while the character + is the required operator supported by the Google search engine." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:157	As discussed earlier, the independence assumption required by certain information-theoretic measures and other Bayesian approaches may not always be valid, especially when we are dealing with linguistics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:157	As such, P(X  Y) negationslash= P(X)P(Y) since the occurrences of ax and ay in documents are inevitably governed by some hidden variables and hence, not independent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:157	Following this, we define the probabilities for two new sets which result from applying some set operations on the basic events in Definition 2: P(X Y) = nxy|N| (5) P(X Y \S) = P(X Y)P(S) where nxy is the page count returned by Google for the search using [+ax +ay]." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:157	Defining P(XY) in terms of observable page counts, rather than a combination of two independent events will allow us to avoid any unnecessary assumption of independence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:157	Next, referring back to our main problem discussed in Definition 1, we are required to estimate the strength of collocation of the two units ax and ay." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:157	Since there is no standard metric for such measurement, we propose to address the problem from a probabilistic perspective." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:157	We introduce the probability that s is a stable lexical unit given the evidence s possesses: Definition 3 Probability of unithood: P(U|E) = P(E|U)P(U)P(E) where U is the event that s is a stable lexical unit and E is the evidences belonging to s. P(U|E) is the posterior probability that s is a stable unit given the evidence E. P(U) is the prior probability that s is a unit without any evidence, and P(E) is the prior probability of evidences held by s. As we shall see later, these two prior probabilities will be immaterial in the final computation of unithood." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:157	Since s can either be a stable unit or not, we can state that, P(U|E) = 1P(U|E) (6) 106 where U is the event that s is not a stable lexical unit." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:157	Since Odds = P/(1  P), we multiply both sides of Definition 3 by (1P(U|E))1 to obtain, P(U|E) 1P(U|E) = P(E|U)P(U) P(E)(1P(U|E)) (7) By substituting Equation 6 in Equation 7 and later, applying the multiplication rule P(U|E)P(E) = P(E|U)P(U) to it, we will obtain: P(U|E) P(U|E) = P(E|U)P(U) P(E|U)P(U) (8) We proceed to take the log of the odds in Equation 8 (i.e. logit) to get: log P(E|U)P(E|U) = log P(U|E)P(U|E) log P(U)P(U) (9) While it is obvious that certain words tend to cooccur more frequently than others (i.e. idioms and collocations), such phenomena are largely arbitrary (Smadja, 1993)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="39:210	2.2 The Probability of a Parse Tree The parse trees produced by our parser are binarybranching and rather deep." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:210	In order to compute the probability of a parse tree, it is transformed to a flat dependency tree similar to the syntax graph representation used in the TIGER treebank Brants et al (2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:210	An inner node of such a dependency tree represents a constituent or phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:210	Typically, it directly connects to a leaf node representing the most important word of the phrase, the head child." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:210	The other children represent phrases or words directly depending on the head child." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:210	To give an example, the immediate children of a sentence node are the finite verb (the head child), the adverbials, the subject and the all other (verbal and non-verbal) complements." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:210	This flat structure has the advantage that the information which is most relevant for the head child is represented within the locality of an inner node." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:210	Assuming statistical independence between the internal structures of the inner nodes ni, we can factor P(T) much like it is done for probabilistic contextfree grammars: P(T)  productdisplay ni P(childtags(ni)|tag(ni)) (4) In the above equation, tag(ni) is simply the label assigned to the tree node ni, and childtags(ni) denotes the tags assigned to the child nodes of ni." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:210	Our statistical model for German sentences distinguishes between eight different tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:210	Three tags are used for different types of noun phrases: pronominal NPs, non-pronominal NPs and prenominal genitives." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="58:210	The resulting probability distributions were trained on the German TIGER treebank which consists of about 50000 sentences of newspaper text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:210	2.3 Robustness Issues A major problem of grammar-based approaches to language modeling is how to deal with out-ofgrammar utterances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:210	Obviously, the utterance to be recognized may be ungrammatical, or it could be grammatical but not covered by the given grammar." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:210	But even if the utterance is both grammatical and covered by the grammar, the correct word sequence may not be among the N best hypotheses due to out-of-vocabulary words or bad acoustic conditions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:210	In all these cases, the best hypothesis available is likely to be out-of-grammar, but the language model should nevertheless prefer it to competing hypotheses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:210	To make things worse, it is not unlikely that some of the competing hypotheses are grammatical." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:210	It is therefore important that our language model is robust with respect to out-of-grammar sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:210	In particular this means that it should provide a reasonable parse tree for any possible word sequence W. However, our approach is to use an accurate, linguistically motivated grammar, and it is undesirable to weaken the constraints encoded in the grammar. Instead, we allow the parser to attach any sequence of words or correct phrases to the root node, where each attachment is penalized by the probabilistic model P(T)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:210	This can be thought of as adding two probabilistic context-free rules: S  Sprime S with probability q S  Sprime with probability 1q In order to guarantee that all possible word sequences are parseable, Sprime can produce both saturated phrases and arbitrary words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:210	To include such a productive set of rules into the grammar would lead to serious efficiency problems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:210	For this reason, these rules were actually implemented as a dynamic programming pass: after the parser has identified all correct phrases, the most probable sequence of phrases or words is computed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:210	2.4 Model Parameters Besides the distributions required to specify P(T), our language model has three parameters: the language model weight , the attachment probability q and the number of hypotheses N. The parameters  and q are considered to be task-dependent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:210	For instance, if the utterances are well-covered by the grammar and the acoustic conditions are good, it can be expected that  is relatively large and that q is relatively small." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:210	The choice of N is restricted by the available computing power." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:210	For our experiments, we chose N = 100." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:210	The influence of N on the word error rate is discussed in the results section." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:210	3 Linguistic Resources 3.1 Particularities of the Recognizer Output The linguistic resources presented in this Section are partly influenced by the form of the recognizer output." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:210	In particular, the speech recognizer does not always transcribe numbers, compounds and acronyms as single words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:210	For instance, the word einundzwanzig (twenty-one) is transcribed as ein und zwanzig, Kriegsplane (war plans) as Kriegs Plane and BMW as B. M. W. These transcription variants are considered to be correct by our evaluation scheme." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:210	Therefore, the grammar should accept them as well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:210	3.2 Grammar and Parser We used the Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG, see Pollard and Sag (1994)) formalism to develop a precise large-coverage grammar for German.

	<td class="line x" title="82:210	We do not make this distinction but rather let immediate dominance schemata specify constituent order." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:210	Further, the formalism allows to express complex linguistic constraints by means of predicates or relational constraints." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="89:210	In addition, we have modeled a few constructions which occur frequently but are often neglected in formal syntactic theories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:210	Among them are prenominal and postnominal genitives, expressions of quantity and expressions of date and time." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:93	The size of the initial population varied between 50 and 50 thousand randomly generated solutions." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="61:93	To examine the effects of including some known AMs on the performance, the following AMs had a 50% chance of being included in the initial population: pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990), the Dice coefficient, and the heuristic measure defined in (Petrovic et al., 2006): H(a,b,c) =    2log f(abc)f(a)f(c) if POS(b) = X, log f(abc)f(a)f(b)f(c) otherwise." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="85:93	4 Conclusion In this paper we described a genetic programming approach for evolving new lexical association measures in order to extract collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:93	The evolved association measure will perform at least as good as any other AM included in the initial population." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:93	However, the evolved association measure may be a complex expression that defies interpretation, in which case it may be treated as a blackbox suitable for the specific task of collocation extraction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:93	Our approach only requires an evaluation sample, thus it is not limited to any specific type of collocation, language or corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:93	The preliminary experiments, conducted on a corpus of Croatian documents, showed that the best evolved measures outperformed other considered association measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:93	Also, most of the best evolved association measures took into account the linguistic information about an n-gram (the POS of the individual words)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:93	As part of future work, we intend to apply our approach to corpora in other languages and compare the results with existing collocation extraction systems." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:149	To determine word co-occurrences, for each word in the corpus it was counted how often its close neighbors occurred within a text window of plus and minus six words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:149	Assuming that approximately every second word is a function word, a window size of plus and minus six words after removal of the function words roughly corresponds to a window size of plus and minus 12 words without such pre-processing." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="66:149	It can be expected that the log-likelihood ratio produces an accurate ranking of word pairs that highly correlates with human judgment (Dunning, 1993), although there are other measures which come close in performance (e.g. Rapp, 1998)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:149	To compute the associations to pairs of stimulus words, it would in principle be possible to consider text positions where both stimulus words occur together, and to count the cooccurrence frequencies with their neighboring words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="70:149	We therefore propose another approach, which to our knowledge is novel in this context: The idea is that a potential associative response to a pair of stimulus words should have a strong and preferably symmetric associative connection to each of the stimulus words, and that a strong association to only one of them does not suffice." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:149	Such a behavior can usually be ensured by a multiplication." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="76:149	These considerations lead us to the following procedure: Given an association matrix of vocabulary V containing the log-likelihood ratios between all possible pairs of words, to compute the associative response given words a and b, the following steps are conducted: 1) For each word in V (by applying a searchand-compare operation on the association matrix) look up the ranks of words a and b in its list of associations, and compute the product of these ranks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:149	2) Sort the words in V according to these products, with the sort order such that the lowest value obtains the top rank (i.e. conduct a reverse sort)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="79:149	(The application presented in section 5.2 successfully processes 30 stimulus words.)" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:149	A minor issue is the assignment of ranks to words that have identical log-likelihood scores, especially in the frequent case of zero cooccurrence counts." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="179:222	In order to study this difference, we performed classification analysis separately for the attribute-specifying adjectives and the objectmodifying adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="180:222	Our hypothesis is that the phrases with attribute-specifying adjectives will be much more difficult to distinguish from the original nouns than the adjectives that change the referent." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="182:222	To verify this, Gaussian Nave Bayes classifiers were trained to discriminate between each of the 12 pairs of nouns and adjective-noun phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="183:222	The average classification for phrases with object-modifying adjectives is 0.76, whereas classification accuracies for phrases with attribute-specifying adjectives are 0.68." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="184:222	The difference is statistically significant at p < 0.05." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="199:222	Unlike adjective-noun phrases, where a single interpretation often dominates, noun-noun combinations allow multiple interpretations (e.g., carrot knife can be interpreted as a knife that is specifically used to cut carrots or a knife carved out of carrots)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="205:222	Multiplicative composition models outperform additive models, a trend that is consistent with the assumption that people use adjectives to modify the meaning of the noun, rather than conjoining the meaning of the adjective and noun." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="206:222	In this study, we represented the meaning of both adjectives and nouns in terms of their cooccurrences with 5 sensory verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="207:222	While this type of representation might be justified for concrete nouns (hypothesizing that their neural representations are largely grounded in sensorymotor features), it might be that a different representation is needed for adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="208:222	Further research is needed to investigate alternative representations for both nouns and adjectives." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="210:222	We look forward to future research to extend the intermediate representation and to experiment with different modeling methodologies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="211:222	An alternative approach is to model the semantic representation as a hidden variable using a generative probabilistic model that describes how neural activity is generated from some latent semantic representation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="212:222	We are currently exploring the infinite latent semantic feature model (ILFM; Griffiths & Ghahramani, 2005), which assumes a non-parametric Indian Buffet prior to the binary feature vector and models neural activation with a linear Gaussian model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="213:222	The basic proposition of the model is that the human semantic knowledge system is capable of storing an infinite list of features (or semantic components) associated with a concept; however, only a subset is actively recalled during any given task (contextdependent)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="214:222	Thus, a set of latent indicator variables is introduced to indicate whether a feature is actively recalled at any given task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="215:222	We are investigating if the compositional models also operate in the learned latent semantic space." ></td>
