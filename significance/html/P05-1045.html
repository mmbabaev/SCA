	<td class="line x" title="6:221	1 Introduction Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental language analysis task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:221	In POS tagging, we frequently encounter words that do not exist in training data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:221	Such words are called unknown words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:221	They are usually handled by an exceptional process in POS tagging, because the tagging system does not have information about the words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:221	Guessing the POS tags of such unknown words is a difficult task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:221	But it is an important issue both for conducting POS tagging accurately and for creating word dictionaries automatically or semiautomatically." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:221	There have been many studies on POS guessing of unknown words (Mori and Nagao, 1996; Mikheev, 1997; Chen et al. , 1997; Nagata, 1999; Orphanos and Christodoulakis, 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:221	In most of these previous works, POS tags of unknown words were predicted using only local information, such as lexical forms and POS tags of surrounding words or word-internal features (e.g. suffixes and character types) of the unknown words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:221	However, this approach has limitations in available information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:221	For example, common nouns and proper nouns are sometimes difficult to distinguish with only the information of a single occurrence because their syntactic functions are almost identical." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:221	In English, proper nouns are capitalized and there is generally little ambiguity between common nouns and proper nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:221	In Chinese and Japanese, no such convention exists and the problem of the ambiguity is serious." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:221	However, if an unknown word with the same lexical form appears in another part with informative local features (e.g. titles of persons), this will give useful clues for guessing the part-of-speech of the ambiguous one, because unknown words with the same lexical form usually have the same part-of-speech." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:221	For another example, there is a part-of-speech named sahen-noun (verbal noun) in Japanese." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:221	Verbal nouns behave as common nouns, except that they are used as verbs when they are followed by a verb suru; e.g., a verbal noun dokusho means reading and dokusho-suru is a verb meaning to read books." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:221	It is difficult to distinguish a verbal noun from a common noun if it is used as a noun." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:221	However, it will be easy if we know that the word is followed by suru in another part in the document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:221	This issue was mentioned by Asahara (2003) as a problem of possibility-based POS tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:221	A possibility-based POS tag is a POS tag that represents all the possible properties of the word (e.g. , a verbal noun is used as a noun or a verb), rather than a property of each instance of the word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:221	For example, a sahennoun is actually a noun that can be used as a verb when it is followed by suru." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:221	This property cannot be confirmed without observing real usage of the word appearing with suru." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:221	Such POS tags may not be identified with only local information of one instance, because the property that each instance has is only one among all the possible properties." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:221	To cope with these issues, we propose a method that uses global information as well as local information for guessing the parts-of-speech of unknown words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:221	With this method, all the occurrences of the unknown words in a document1 are taken into consideration at once, rather than that each occurrence of the words is processed separately." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:221	Thus, the method models the whole document and finds a set of parts-of-speech by maximizing its conditional joint probability given the document, rather than independently maximizing the probability of each part-of-speech given each sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line pc" title="31:221	Global information is known to be useful in other NLP tasks, especially in the named entity recognition task, and several studies successfully used global features (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Finkel et al. , 2005)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="34:221	Global features can be increased by simply adding unlabeled data into the test data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:221	Models in which the whole document is taken into consideration need a lot of computation compared to models with only local features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:221	They also cannot process input data one-by-one." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:221	Instead, the entire document has to be read before processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:221	We adopt Gibbs sampling in order to compute the models efficiently, and these models are suitable for offline use such as creating dictionaries from raw text where real-time processing is not necessary but high-accuracy is needed to reduce human labor required for revising automatically analyzed data." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="43:221	We assume that POS tags of known words are already determined beforehand, and positions in the document where unknown words appear are also identified." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:221	Thus, we focus only on prediction of the POS tags of unknown words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="47:221	A method for incorporating unlabeled data with the model is also discussed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:221	2.1 Probabilistic Model Using Global Information We attempt to model the probability distribution of the parts-of-speech of all occurrences of the unknown words in a document which have thesame lexical form." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:221	We suppose that such partsof-speech have correlation, and the part-of-speech of each occurrence is also affected by its local context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:221	Similar situations to this are handled inphysics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:221	For example, let us consider a case where a number of electrons with spins exist in a system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:221	The spins interact with each other, and each spin is also affected by the external magnetic field." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:221	In the physical model, if the state of the system is s and the energy of the system is E(s), the probability distribution of s is known to be represented by the following Boltzmann distribution: P(s)= 1Z expE(s)}, (1) where  is inverse temperature and Z is a normalizing constant defined as follows: Z= summationdisplay s expE(s)}." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:221	(2) Takamura et al.(2005) applied this model to an NLP task, semantic orientation extraction, and we apply it to POS guessing of unknown words here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:221	Suppose that unknown words with the same lexical form appear K times in a document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:221	Assume that the number of possible POS tags for unknown words is N, and they are represented by integers from 1 to N. Let tk denote the POS tag of the kth occurrence of the unknown words, let wk denotethe local context (e.g. the lexical forms and the POS tags of the surrounding words) of the kth occurrence of the unknown words, and let w and tdenote the sets of w k and tk respectively: w={w1,,wK}, t={t1,,tK}, tk{1,,N}." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:221	The right hand side of the above equation consists of two components; one represents global interactions between each pair of parts-of-speech, and the other represents the effects of local information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:221	In this study, we fix the inverse temperature  = 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:221	The distribution of t is then obtained from Equation (1), (2) and (3) as follows: P(t|w)= 1Z(w)p0(t|w)exp braceleftBigg 1 2 Ksummationdisplay k=1 Ksummationdisplay kprime=1 kprimenegationslash=k tk,tkprime bracerightBigg, (4) Z(w)= summationdisplay tT(w) p0(t|w)exp braceleftBigg 1 2 Ksummationdisplay k=1 Ksummationdisplay kprime=1 kprimenegationslash=k tk,tkprime bracerightBigg, (5) p0(t|w) Kproductdisplay k=1 p0(tk|wk), (6) where T(w) is the set of possible configurations of POS tags given w. The size of T(w) is NK, because there are K occurrences of the unknownwords and each unknown word can have one of N POS tags." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="65:221	As shown above, we consider the conditional joint probability of all the occurrences of the unknown words with the same lexical form in the document given their local contexts, P(t|w), in contrast to conventional approaches which assume independence of the sentences in the document and use the probabilities of all the words only in a sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:221	Note that we assume independence between the unknown words with different lexical forms, and each set of the unknown words with the same lexical form is processed separately from the sets of other unknown words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="68:221	One way to do this is to find a set of POS tags which maximizes P(t|w) among all possible candidates of t. However, the number of all possible candidates of the POS tags is NK and the calculation is generally intractable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:221	Although HMMs, MEMMs, and CRFs use dynamic programming and some studies with probabilistic models which have specific structures use efficient algorithms (Wang et al. , 2005), such methods cannot be applied here because we are considering interactions (dependencies) between all POS tags, and their joint distribution cannot be decomposed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:221	Therefore, we use a sampling technique and approximate the solution using samples obtained from the probability distribution." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:221	We can obtain a solution t = {t1,,tK} as follows: tk=argmax t Pk(t|w), (11) where Pk(t|w) is the marginal distribution of the part-of-speech of the kth occurrence of the unknown words given a set of local contexts w, and is calculated as an expected value over the distribution of the unknown words as follows: Pk(t|w)= summationdisplay t1,,tk1,tk+1,,tK tk=t P(t|w), = summationdisplay tT(w) (tk,t)P(t|w)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="31:161	3 Adoption for Transliteration Pairs Mining We adopt the basic methodology presented in [Klementiev and Roth, 2006], but we focus on three specific issues described in the introduction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:161	3.1 Mining of Transliteration Pairs We start with comparable corpora in English and Tamil, similar in size to that used in [Klementiev and Roth, 2006], and using the English side of this corpora, first, we extract all the NEs that occur more than a given threshold parameter, FE, using a standard NER tool." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:161	The higher the threshold is, the more will be the evidence for legitimate transliteration pairs, in the comparable corpora, which may be captured by the mining methodology." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:161	The extracted list of NEs provides the set of NEs in English, for which we mine for transliteration pairs from the Tamil side of the comparable corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:161	We need to identify all NEs in the Tamil side of the corpora, in order to appropriately pair-up with English NEs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:161	However, given that there is no publicly available NER tool in Tamil (as the case may be in many resource-poor languages) we start with an assumption that all words found in the Tamil corpus are potentially NEs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:161	However, since Tamil is a highly morphologically inflected language, the same NE may occur in its various inflected forms in the Tamil side of the corpora; hence, we collect those words with the same prefix (of fixed size) into a single bucket, called equivalence class, and consider a representative prefix, referred to as signature of the collection for comparison." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:161	The assumption here is that the common prefix would stand for a Tamil NE, and all the members of the equivalence class are the various inflected forms of the NE." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:161	We use such a signature to classify a Tamil word as potential transliteration of an English word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:161	Again, we consider only those signatures that have occurred more than a threshold parameter, FT, in the Tamil side of the comparable corpora, in order to strengthen support for a meaningful similarity in their frequency of occurrence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:161	We used a linear Support Vector Machine classifier (details given in a later section) trained on a sizable seed corpus of transliterations between English and Tamil, and use it to identify potential Tamil signatures with any of the NEs extracted from the English side." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:161	We try to match each of the NEs extracted from the English side, to every signature from the Tamil side, and produce an ordered list of Tamil signatures that may be potential transliterations for a given English NE." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:161	Every Tamil signature, thus, would get a score, which is used to rank the signatures in the decreasing order of similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:161	Subsequently, we consider only those above a certain threshold for analysis, and in addition, consider only the top-n candidates." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:161	3.2 Quality Refinement Since a number of such transliteration candidates are culled from the Tamil corpus for a given NE in English, we further cull out unlikely candidates, by re-ranking them using frequency cues from the aligned comparable corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:161	For this, we start with the hypothesis, that the NEs will have similar normalized frequency distributions with respect to time, in the two corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:161	Given that the news corpora are expected to contain same names in similar time periods in the two different languages, the frequency distribution of words in the two languages provides a strong clue about possible transliteration pairs; however, such potential pairs might also include other content words, such as,    (soshaliSt),   (kavanamaaka),   (keetpathu), etc., which are common nouns, adjectives or even adverbs and verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:161	On the other hand, function words are expected to be uniformly distributed in the corpus, and hence may not have high variability like content words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:161	Note that the NEs in English are not usually inflected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:161	Since Tamil NEs usually have inflections, the frequency of occurrence of a NE in Tamil must be normalized across all forms, to make it reasonably comparable to the frequency of the corresponding English NE." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:161	This was taken care of by considering the signature and its equivalence class." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:161	Hence the frequency of occurrence of a NE (i.e., its signature) in Tamil is the sum of frequencies of all members in its equivalence class." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:161	For identifying the names between the languages, we first create a frequency distribution of every word in English and Tamil, by creating temporal bins of specific duration, covering the entire timeline of the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:161	The frequency is calculated as the number of occurrences of each signature in the bin interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:161	Once the frequency distributions are formed, they are normalized for every signature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:161	Given the normalized frequencies, two words are considered to have same (or, similar) pattern of occurrence in the corpus, if the normalized frequency vectors of the two words are the same (or, close within a threshold)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:161	Figure 1 shows the frequency of the word Abishek, and its Tamil version,   (apishek) as a frequency plot, where a high correlation between the frequencies can be observed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:161	Figure 1: Names Frequency Plot in Comparable Corpora  Hence, to refine the quality of the classifier output, we re-rank the list of candidates, using the distance between the frequency vectors of the English NE, and the Tamil candidate signature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:161	This step moves up those signatures that have similar patterns of occurrence, and moves down those that do not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:161	It is likely that such frequency cues from the comparable corpora will make the quality of matched transliteration pairs better, yielding better mined data." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="66:161	While the number of      articles used were roughly the same (~2,400), the number of words in Tamil were only about 70% of that in English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:161	This is partially due to the fact Tamil is a highly agglutinative language, where various affixes (prefixes and suffixes of other content words) stand for function words and prepositions in English, thus do not contribute to the word count." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:161	Further, since our focus is on mining names, we expect the same NEs to be covered in both the corpora, and hence we do not expect a severe impact on mining." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:257	Traditional learning-based coreference resolvers operate by training a model for classifying whether two mentions are co-referring or not (e.g., Soon et al.(2001), Ng and Cardie (2002b), Kehler et al.(2004), Ponzetto and Strube (2006))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:257	Despite their initial successes, these mention-pair models have at least two major weaknesses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:257	First, since each candidate antecedent for a mention to be resolved (henceforth an active mention) is considered independently of the others, these models only determine how good a candidate antecedent is relative to the active mention, but not how good a candidate antecedent is relative to other candidates." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:257	In other words, they fail to answer the critical question of which candidate antecedent is most probable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:257	Second, they have limitations in their expressiveness: the information extracted from the two mentions alone may not be sufficient for making an informed coreference decision, especially if the candidate antecedent is a pronoun (which is semantically empty) or a mention that lacks descriptive information such as gender (e.g., Clinton)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:257	To address the first weakness, researchers have attempted to train a mention-ranking model for determining which candidate antecedent is most probable given an active mention (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2008))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:257	Ranking is arguably a more natural reformulation of coreference resolution than classification, as a ranker allows all candidate antecedents to be considered simultaneously and therefore directly captures the competition among them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:257	Another desirable consequence is that there exists a natural resolution strategy for a ranking approach: a mention is resolved to the candidate antecedent that has the highest rank." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:257	This contrasts with classification-based approaches, where many clustering algorithms have been employed to co-ordinate the pairwise coreference decisions (because it is unclear which one is the best)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:257	To address the second weakness, researchers have investigated the acquisition of entity-mention coreference models (e.g., Luo et al.(2004), Yang et al.(2004))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:257	Unlike mention-pair models, these entity-mention models are trained to determine whether an active mention belongs to a preceding, possibly partially-formed, coreference cluster." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:257	Hence, they can employ cluster-level features (i.e., features that are defined over any subset of mentions in a preceding cluster), which makes them more expressive than mention-pair models." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:257	Motivated in part by these recently developed models, we propose in this paper a clusterranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention-ranking mod968 els and entity-mention models." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:257	Specifically, we recast coreference as the problem of determining which of a set of preceding coreference clusters is the best to link to an active mention using a learned cluster ranker." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:257	In addition, we show how discourse-new detection (i.e., the task of determining whether a mention introduces a new entity in a discourse) can be learned jointly with coreference resolution in our cluster-ranking framework." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:257	It is worth noting that researchers typically adopt a pipeline coreference architecture, performing discourse-new detection prior to coreference resolution and using the resulting information to prevent a coreference system from resolving mentions that are determined to be discourse-new (see Poesio et al.(2004) for an overview)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:257	As a result, errors in discourse-new detection could be propagated to the resolver, possibly leading to a deterioration of coreference performance (see Ng and Cardie (2002a))." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:257	Bridging the gap between machine-learning approaches and linguistically-motivated approaches to coreference resolution." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:257	While machine learning approaches to coreference resolution have received a lot of attention since the mid90s, popular learning-based coreference frameworks such as the mention-pair model are arguably rather unsatisfactory from a linguistic point of view." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="39:257	Our work bridges this gap by realizing in a new machine learning framework ideas rooted in Lappin and Leasss (1994) heuristic-based pronoun resolver, which in turn was motivated by classic salience-based approaches to anaphora resolution." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="47:257	2 Related Work Heuristic-based cluster ranking." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:257	As mentioned previously, the work most related to ours is Lappin and Leass (1994), whose goal is to perform pronoun resolution by assigning an anaphoric pronoun to the highest-scored preceding cluster." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:257	Nevertheless, Lappin and Leasss work differs from ours in several respects." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:257	First, they only tackle pronoun resolution rather than the full coreference task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:257	Second, their algorithm is heuristic-based; in particular, the score assigned to a preceding cluster is computed by summing over the weights associated with the factors applicable to the cluster, where the weights are determined heuristically, rather than learned, unlike ours." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:257	Like many heuristic-based pronoun resolvers (e.g., Mitkov (1998)), they first apply a set of constraints to filter grammatically incompatible candidate antecedents and then rank the remaining ones using salience factors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:257	As a result, their cluster-ranking model employs only factors that capture the salience of a cluster, and can therefore be viewed as a simple model of attentional state (see Grosz and Sidner (1986)) realized by coreference clusters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:257	By contrast, our resolution strategy is learned without applying hand-coded con969 straints in a separate filtering step." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:257	In particular, we attempt to determine the compatibility between a cluster and an active mention, using factors that determine not only salience (e.g., the distance between the cluster and the mention) but also lexical and grammatical compatibility, for instance." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:257	Contrary to common wisdom, this entity-mention model underperforms its mention-pair counterpart in spite of the generalization from mention-pair to cluster-level features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:257	In Yang et al.s (2004) entity-mention model, a training instance is composed of an active mention mk, a preceding cluster C, and a mention mj in C that is closest in distance to mk in the associated text." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:257	In other words, the model still relies heavily on features used in a mention-pair model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:257	In particular, the inclusion of mj in the feature vector representation to some extent reflects the authors lack of confidence that a strong entity-mention model can be trained without mention-pair-based features." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="33:186	Naturally, they mention the same NEs (such as Barack Obama, John Roberts, White House) in the respective languages, and hence, are rich sources of NETEs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:186	Our empirical investigation of comparable corpora confirmed the above insight." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:186	A study of  2 News articles from the BBC corpus had, on an average, 12.9 NEs and new articles from the The New Indian Express, about 11.8 NEs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:186	200 pairs of similar news articles published by The New Indian Express in 2007 in English and Tamil showed that 87% of the single word NEs in the English articles had at least one transliteration equivalent in the conjugate Tamil articles." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="38:186	However, there are several challenges to the mining process: firstly, vast majority of the NEs in comparable corpora are very sparse; our analysis showed that 80% of the NEs in The New Indian Express news corpora appear less than 5 times in the entire corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:186	Hence, any mining method that depends mainly on repeated occurrences of the NEs in the corpora is likely to miss vast majority of the NETEs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:186	Secondly, the mining method must restrict the candidate NETEs that need to be examined for match to a reasonably small number, not only to minimize false positives but also to be computationally efficient." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:186	Thirdly, the use of linguistic tools and resources must be kept to a minimum as resources are available only in a handful of languages." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:220	Firstly, in domain adaptation the different tasks are actually just different domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:220	Secondly, in multi-task learning the focus is on improving performance across all tasks, while in domain adaptation there is a distinction between source data and target data, and the goal is to improve performance on the target data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:220	In the present work we focus on domain adaptation, but like the multi-task setting, we wish to improve performance across all domains and not a single target domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:220	The word domain is used here somewhat loosely: it may refer to a topical domain or to distinctions that linguists might term mode (speech versus writing) or register (formal written prose versus SMS communications)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:220	For example, one may have a large amount of parsed newswire, and want to use it to augment a much smaller amount of parsed e-mail, to build a higher quality parser for e-mail data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:220	We also consider the extension to the task where the annotation is not the same, but is consistent, across domains (that is, some domains may be annotated with more information than others)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:220	This problem is important because it is omnipresent in real life natural language processing tasks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:220	Annotated data is expensive to produce and limited in quantity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:220	Typically, one may begin with a considerable amount of annotated newswire data, some annotated speech data, and a little annotated e-mail data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:220	It would be most desirable if the aggregated training data could be used to improve the performance of a system on each of these domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:220	From the baseline of building separate systems for each domain, the obvious first attempt at domain adaptation is to build a system from the union of the training data, and we will refer to this as a second baseline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:220	In this paper we propose a more principled, formal model of domain adaptation, which not only outperforms previous work, but maintains attractive 602 performance characteristics in terms of training and testing speed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:220	We also show that the domain adaptation work of (Daume III, 2007), which is presented as an ad-hoc preprocessing step, is actually equivalent to our formal model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:220	However, our representation of the model conceptually separates some of the hyperparameters which are not separated in (Daume III, 2007), and we found that setting these hyperparameters with different values from one another was critical for improving performance." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="29:220	There will be a parameter (weight) for each feature, and usually there is a zero-mean Gaussian prior over the parameter values so that they dont get too large.1 In the standard, single-domain, case the log likelihood of the data and prior is calculated, and the optimal parameter values are found." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:220	Now, lets extend this model to the case of two domains, one containing American newswire and the other containing British newswire." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:220	The data distributions will be similar for the two domains, but not identical." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:220	In our model, we have separate parameters for each feature in each domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:220	We also have a top level parameter (also to be learned) for each feature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:220	For each domain, the Gaussian prior over the parameter values is now centered around these top level parameters instead of around zero." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:220	A zero-mean Gaussian prior is then placed over the top level parameters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:220	In this example, if some feature, say word=Nigel, only appears in the British newswire, the corresponding weight for the American newswire will have a similar value." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:220	This happens because the evidence in the British domain will push the British parameter 1This can be regarded as a Bayesian prior or as weight regularization; we adopt the former perspective here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:220	to have a high value, and this will in turn influence the top-level parameter to have a high value, which will then influence the American newswire to have a high value, because there will be no evidence in the American data to override the prior." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:220	Conversely, if some feature is highly indicative of isName=true for the British newswire, and of isName=false for the American newswire, then the British parameter will have a high (positive) value while the American parameter will have a low (negative) value, because in both cases the domain-specific evidence will outweigh the effect of the prior." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:220	2.2 Formal Model Our domain adaptation model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian prior, through which the domainspecific parameters are tied." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:220	The model is very general-purpose, and can be applied to any discriminative learning task for which one would typically put a prior with a mean over the parameters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:220	We will build up to it by first describing a general, singledomain, discriminative learning task, and then we will show how to modify this model to construct our hierarchical Bayesian domain adaptation model." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:220	First, we place a zero-mean Gaussian prior over the top level parameters ." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:220	Then, these top level parameters are used as the mean for a Gaussian prior placed over each of the domain-specific parameters d. These domain-specific parameters are then the parameters used in the original conditional log likelihood functions for each domain." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:220	Conversely, the higher-level parameters will largely determine the domain-specific parameters when there is little or no evidence from within a domain, but can be overriden by domain-specific evidence when it clearly goes against the general picture (for instance Leeds is normally a location, but within the sports domain is usually an organization (football team))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:220	The beauty of this model is that the degree of influence each domain exerts over the others, for each parameter, is based on the amount of evidence each domain has about that parameter." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="66:220	However, when a domain lacks evidence for a parameter the opposite occurs, and the prior (whose value is determined by evidence in the other domains) will have a greater effect on the parameter value." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="72:220	Our hierarchical Bayesian domain adaptation model is directed, as illustrated in Figure 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:220	However, somewhat counterintuitively, the underlying (original) model of the data can be either directed or undirected, and for our experiments we use undi604 rected, conditional random field-based models." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:220	The directed domain adaptation model can be viewed as a model of the parameters, and those parameter weights are used by the underlying data model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:220	In Figure 1, the entire data model is represented by a single node, D, conditioned on the parameters,  or d. The form of that model can then be almost anything, including an undirected model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:220	From an implementation perspective, the objective function is not much more difficult to implement than the original single-domain model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:220	For all of our experiments, we optimized the log likelihood using L-BFGS, which requires the function value and partial derivatives of each parameter." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="81:220	Once the optimal parameters have been learned, the top level parameters can be discarded, since the runtime model for each domain is the same as the original (single-domain) model, parameterized by the parameters learned for that domain in the hierarchical model." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="87:220	Despite having many more parameters, for both of the tasks on which we performed experiments, we found that our model did not take much more time to train that a baseline model trained on all of the data concatenated together." ></td>
