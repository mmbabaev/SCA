	<td class="line x" title="7:208	In addition to the alternatives introduced from the different word senses of the source language word, the target language may specify additional alternatives that differ mainly in their usages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:208	Traditionally various linguistic levels were used to deal with this problem: syntactic, semantic and pragmatic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:208	Computationally the syntactic methods are the easiest, but are of no avail in the frequent situation when the different senses of the word show *This research was partially supported by grant number 120-741 of the Iarael Council for Research and Development the same syntactic behavior, having the same part of speech and even the same subcategorization frame." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:208	Substantial application of semantic or pragmatic knowledge about the word and its context for broad domains requires compiling huge amounts of knowledge, whose usefulness for practical applications has not yet been proven (Lenat et al. , 1990; Nirenburg et al. , 1988; Chodorow et al. , 1985)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:208	Moreover, such methods fail to reflect word usages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:208	It is known for many years that the use of a word in the language provides information about its meaning (Wittgenstein, 1953)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:208	Also, statistical approaches which were popular few decades ago have recently reawakened and were found useful for computational linguistics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:208	Consequently, a possible (though partial) alternative to using manually constructed knowledge can be found in the use of statistical data on the occurrence of lexical relations in large corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="15:208	The use of such relations (mainly relations between verbs or nouns and their arguments and modifiers) for various purposes has received growing attention in recent research (Church and Hanks, 1990; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Hindle, 1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="16:208	More specifically, two recent works have suggested to use statistical data on lexical relations for resolving ambiguity cases of PP-attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1990) and pronoun references (Dagan and Itai, 1990a; Dagan and Itai, 1990b)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:208	Clearly, statistical methods can be useful also for target word selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:208	Consider, for example, the Hebrew sentence extracted from the foreign news section of the daily Haaretz, September 1990 (transcripted to Latin letters)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:208	130 (1) Nose ze maria' mi-shtei ha-mdinot mi-lahtom 'al hoze shalom." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:208	This sentence would translate into English as: (2) That issue prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:208	The verb 'lab_tom' has four word senses: 'sign', 'seal', 'finish' and 'close'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:208	Whereas the noun 'hose' means both 'contract' and 'treaty'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:208	Here the difference is not in the meaning, but in usage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:208	One possible solution is to consult a Hebrew corpus tagged with word senses, from which we would probably learn that the sense 'sign' of 'lahtom' appears more frequently with 'hoze' as its object than all the other senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:208	Thus we should prefer that sense." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:208	However, the size of corpora required to identify lexical relations in a broad domain is huge (tens of millions of words) and therefore it is usually not feasible to have such corpora manually tagged with word senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:208	The problem of choosing between 'treaty' and 'contract' cannot be solved using only information on Hebrew, because Hebrew does not distinguish between them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:208	The solution suggested in this paper is to identify the lexical relationships in corpora of the target language, instead of the source language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:208	Consulting English corpora of 150 million words, yields the following statistics on single word frequencies: 'sign' appeared 28674 times, 'seal' 2771 times, 'finish' appeared 15595 times, 'close' 38291 times, 'treaty' 7331 times and 'contract' 30757 times." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:208	Using a naive approach of choosing the most frequent word yields (3) *That issue prevented the two countries from closing a peace contract." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:208	This may be improved upon if we use lexical relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:208	We consider word combinations and count how often they appeared in the same syntactic relation as in the ambiguous sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:208	For the above example, among the successfully parsed sentences of the corpus, the noun compound 'peace treaty' appeared 49 times, whereas the compound 'peace contract' did not appear at all; 'to sign a treaty' appeared 79 times while none of the other three alternatives appeared more than twice." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:208	Thus we first prefer 'treaty' to 'contract' because of the noun compound 'peace treaty' and then proceed to prefer 'sign' since it appears most frequently having the object 'treaty' (the order of selection is explained in section 3)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:208	Thus in this case our method yielded the correct translation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:208	Using this method, we take the point of view that some ambiguity problems are easier to solve at the level of the target language instead of the source language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:208	The source language sentences are considered as a noisy source for target language sentences, and our task is to devise a target language model that prefers the most reasonable translation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:208	Machine translation (MT) is thus viewed in part as a recognition problem, and the statistical model we use specifically for target word selection may be compared with other language models in recognition tasks (e.g. Katz (1985) for speech recognition)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:208	In contrast to this view, previous approaches in MT typically resolved examples like (1) by stating various constraints in terms of the source language (Nirenburg, 1987)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:208	As explained before, such constraints cannot be acquired automatically and therefore are usually limited in their coverage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:208	The experiment conducted to test the statistical model clearly shows that the statistics on lexical relations are very useful for disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:208	Most notable is the result for the set of examples for Hebrew to English translation, which was picked randomly from foreign news sections in Israeli press." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:208	For this set, the statistical model was applicable for 70% of the ambiguous words, and its selection was then correct for 92% of the cases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:208	These results for target word selection in machine translation suggest to use a similar mechanism even if we are interested only in word sense disambiguation within a single language!" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:208	In order to select the right sense of a word, in a broad coverage application, it is useful to identify lexical relations between word senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:208	However, within corpora of a single language it is possible to identify automatically only relations at the word level, which are of course not useful for selecting word senses in that language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:208	This is where other languages can supply the solution, exploiting the fact that the mapping between words and word senses varies significantly among different languages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:208	For instance, the English words 'sign' and 'seal' correspond to a very large extent to two distinct senses of the Hebrew word 'lab_tom' (from example (1))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:208	These senses should be distinguished by most applications of Hebrew understanding programs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:208	To make this distinction, it is possible to do the same process that is performed for target word selection, by producing all the English alternatives for the lexical relations involving 'lahtom'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:208	Then the Hebrew sense which corresponds to the most plausible English lexical relations is preferred." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:208	This process requires a bilingual lexicon which maps each Hebrew sense separately into its possible translations, similar 131 to a Hebrew-Hebrew-English lexicon (like the Oxford English-English-Hebrew dictionary (Hornby et al. , 1980))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:208	In some cases, different senses of a Hebrew word map to the same word also in English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:208	In these cases, the lexical relations of each sense cannot be identified in an English corpus, and a third language is required to distinguish among these senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:208	As a long term vision, one can imagine a multilingual corpora based system, which exploits the differences between languages to automatically acquire knowledge about word senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:208	As explained above, this knowledge would be crucial for lexical disambiguation, and will also help to refine other types of knowledge acquired from large corpora 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:208	2 The Linguistic Model The ambiguity of a word is determined by the number of distinct, non-equivalent representations into which the word can be mapped (Van Eynde et al. , 1982)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:208	In the case of machine translation the ambiguity of a source word is thus given by the number of target representations for that word in the bilingual lexicon of the translation system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:208	Given a specific syntactic context the ambiguity can be reduced to the number of alternatives which may appear in that context." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="61:208	In this work we are interested only in those ambiguities that are left after applying all the deterministic syntactic constraints." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:208	For example, consider the following Hebrew sentence, taken from the daily Haaretz, September 1990: (4) Diplomatim svurim ki hitztarrfuto shell Hon Sun magdila et ha.sikkuyim l-hassagat hitqaddmut ba-sihot." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="67:208	We use the term a lezical relation to denote the cooccurrence relation of two (or possibly more) specific words in a sentence, having a certain syntactic relationship between them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:208	Typical relations are between verbs and their subjects, objects, complements, adverbs and modifying prepositional phrases." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="76:208	(noun-pp: H-progress H-in H-talks) The relational representation of a source sentence is reflected also in its translation to a target sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:208	In some cases the relational representation of the target sentence is completely equivalent to that of the source sentence, and can be achieved just by substituting the source words with target words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:208	In other cases, the mapping between source and target relations is more complicated, as is the case for the following German example: (7) Der Tisch gefaellt mir." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="80:208	Here, the original subject of the source sentence becomes the object in the target sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:208	This kind of mapping usually influences the translation process and is therefore encoded in components of the translation program, either explicitly or implicitly, especially in transfer based systems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:208	Our model assumes that such a mapping of source language relations to target language relations is possible, an assumption that is valid for many practical cases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:208	When applying the mapping of relations on one lexicai relation of the source sentence we get several alternatives for a target relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:208	For instance, applying the mapping to example (6-c) we get three alternatives for the relation in the target sentence: (8) (verb-obj: achieve progress) (verb-obj: achieve advance) (verb-obj: achieve advancement) For example (6-d) we get 9 alternatives, since both 'H-progress' and 'H-talks' have three alternative translations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:208	In order to decide which alternative is the most probable, we count the frequencies of all the alternative target relations in very large corpora." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="155:208	6.1 Inapplicability Insufficient data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="156:208	This was the reason for nearly all the cases of inapplicability." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="158:208	In this case it is possible to perform the correct selection if we used only statistics about the cooccurrences of 'corruption' with either 'investigator' or 'researcher', without looking for any syntactic relation (as in Church and Hanks (1990))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="159:208	The use of this statistic is a subject for further research, but our initial data suggests that it can substantially increase the applicability of the statistical method with just a little decrease in its precision." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="160:208	Another way to deal with the lack of statistical data for the specific words in question is to use statistics about similar words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="161:208	This is the basis for Sadler's Analogical Semantics (1989) which has not yet proved effective." ></td>
	<td class="line pc" title="162:208	His results may be improved if more sophisticated techniques and larger corpora are used to establish similarity between words (such as in (Hindle, 1990))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="163:208	Conflicting data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="164:208	In very few cases two alternatives were supported equally by the statistical data, thus preventing a selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="165:208	In such cases, both alternatives are valid at the independent level of the lexical relation, but may be inappropriate for the specific context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="166:208	For instance, the two alternatives of 'to take 135 a job' or 'to take a position' appeared in one of the examples, but since the general context concerned with the position of a prime minister only the latter was appropriate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="167:208	In order to resolve such examples it may be useful to consider also cooccurrences of the ambiguous word with other words in the broader context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="168:208	For instance, the word 'minister' seems to cooccur in the same context more frequently with 'position' than with 'job'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="169:208	In another example both alternatives were appropriate also for the specific context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="170:208	This happened with the German verb 'werfen', which may be translated (among other options) as 'throw', 'cast' or 'score'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="171:208	In our example 'werfen' appeared in the context of 'to throw/cast light' and these two correct alternatives had equal frequencies in the corpus ('score' was successfully eliminated)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="172:208	In such situations any selection between the alternatives will be appropriate and therefore any algorithm that handles conflicting data will work properly." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="173:208	6.2 Incorrect Selection Using the inappropriate relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="174:208	One of the examples contained the Hebrew word 'matzav', which two of its possible translations are 'state' and 'position'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="175:208	The phrase which contained this word was: 'to put an end to the {state I position} of war  '." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="176:208	The ambiguous word is involved in two syntactic relations, being a complement of 'put' and also modified by 'war'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="177:208	The corresponding frequencies were: (9) verb-comp: put-position 320 verb-comp: put-state 18 noun-nob j: state-war 13 noun-nob j: position-war 2 The bound of the odds ration (Ba) for the first relation was higher than for the second, and therefore this relation determined the translation as 'position'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="178:208	However, the correct translation should be 'state', as determined by the second relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="179:208	This example suggests that while ordering the involved relations (or using any other weighting mechanism) it may be necessary to give different weights to the different types of syntactic relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="180:208	For instance, it seems reasonable that the object of a noun should receive greater weight in selecting the noun's sense than the verb for which this noun serves as a complement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="181:208	Confusing senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="182:208	In another example, the Hebrew word 'qatann', which two of its meanings are 'small' and 'young', modified the word 'sikkuy', which means 'prospect' or 'chance'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="183:208	In this context, the correct sense is necessarily 'small'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="184:208	However, the relation that was observed in the corpus was 'young prospect', relating to the human sense of 'prospect' which appeared in sport articles (a promising young person)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="185:208	This borrowed sense of 'prospect' is necessarily inappropriate, since in Hebrew it is represented by the equivalent of 'hope' ('tiqva'), and not by 'sikkuy'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="186:208	The reason for this problem is that after producing the possible target alternatives, our model ignores the source language input as it uses only a monolingual target corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="187:208	This can be solved if we use an aligned bilingual corpus, as suggested by Sadler (1989) and Brown et al.(1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="189:208	In such a corpus the occurrences of the relation 'young prospect' will be aligned to the corresponding occurrences of the Hebrew word 'tiqva', and will not be used when the Hebrew word 'sikkuy' is involved." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="190:208	Yet, it should be brought in mind that an aligned corpus is the result of manual translation, which can be viewed as a manual tagging of the words with their equivalent senses in the other language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="191:208	This resource is much more expensive and less available than the untagged monolingual corpus, while it seems to be necessary only for relatively rare situations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="192:208	Lack of deep understanding." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="193:208	By their nature, statistical methods rely on large quantities of shallow information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="194:208	Thus, they are doomed to fail when disambiguation can rely only on deep understanding of the text and no other surface cues are available." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="195:208	This happened in one of the Hebrew examples, where the two alternatives were either 'emigration law' or 'immigration law' (the Hebrew word 'hagira' is used for both subsenses)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="196:208	While the context indicated that the first alternative is correct, the statistics preferred the second alternative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="197:208	It seems that such cases are quiet rare, but only further evaluation will show the extent to which deep understanding is really needed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="198:208	7 Conclusions The method presented takes advantage of two linguistic phenomena: the different usage of words and word senses among different languages and the importance of lexical cooccurrences within syntactic relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="199:208	The experiment shows that these phenomena are indeed useful for practical disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="200:208	We suggest that the high precision received in the experiment relies on two characteristics of the am136 biguity phenomena, namely the sparseness and redundancy of the disambiguating data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="201:208	By sparseness we mean that within the large space of alternative interpretations produced by ambiguous utterances, only a small portion is commonly used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="202:208	Therefore the chance of an inappropriate interpretation to be observed in the corpus (in other contexts) is low." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="203:208	Redundancy relates to the fact that different informants (such as different lexical relations or deep understanding) tend to support rather than contradict one another, and therefore the chance of picking a 'wrong' informant is low." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="204:208	The examination of the failures suggests that future research may improve both the applicability and precision of the model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="205:208	Our next goal is to handle inapplicable cases by using cooccurrence data regardless of syntactic relations and similarities between words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="206:208	We expect that increasing the applicability will lead to some decrease in precision, similar to the tradeoff between recall and precision in information retrieval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="207:208	Pursuing this tradeoff will improve the performance of the method and reveal its limitations." ></td>

I doubted \[NP the man who liked to eat ice-cream NP\] Current high-coverage parsers tend to use either custom, hand-generated lists of subcategorization frames (e.g. , Hindle, 1983), or published, handgenerated lists like the Ozford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Contemporary English, Hornby and Covey (1973) (e.g. , DeMarcken, 1990)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:189	1.2 WHY IT'S HARD The initial priorities in this research were:." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:189	Generality (e.g. , minimal assumptions about the text) . Accuracy in identifying SF occurrences  Simplicity of design and speed Efficient use of the available text was not a high priority, since it was felt that plenty of text was available even for an inefficient learner, assuming sufficient speed to make use of it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:189	These priorities 209 had a substantial influence on the approach taken." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:189	They are evaluated in retrospect in Section 4." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:189	The first step in finding a subcategorization frame is finding a verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:189	Because of widespread and productive noun/verb ambiguity, dictionaries are not much use -they do not reliably exclude the possibility oflexical ambiguity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:189	Even if they did, a program that could only learn SFs for unambiguous verbs would be of limited value." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:189	Statistical disambiguators make dictionaries more useful, but they have a fairly high error rate, and degrade in the presence of many unfamiliar words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:189	Further, it is often difficult to understand where the error is coming from or how to correct it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:189	So finding verbs poses a serious challenge for the design of an accurate, general-purpose algorithm for detecting SFs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:189	In fact, finding main verbs is more difficult than it might seem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:189	One problem is distinguishing participles from adjectives and nouns, as shown below." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:189	(2) a. John has \[~p rented furniture\] (comp.: John has often rented apartments) b. John was smashed (drunk) last night (comp.: John was kissed last night) c. John's favorite activity is watching TV (comp.: John's favorite child is watching TV) In each case the main verb is have or be in a context where most parsers (and statistical disambiguators) would mistake it for an auxiliary and mistake the following word for a participial main verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:189	A second challenge to accuracy is determining which verb to associate a given complement with." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:189	Paradoxically, example (1) shows that in general it isn't possible to do this without already knowing the SF." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:189	One obvious strategy would be to wait for sentences where there is only one candidate verb; unfortunately, it is very difficult to know for certain how many verbs occur in a sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:189	Finding some of the verbs in a text reliably is hard enough; finding all of them reliably is well beyond the scope of this work." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:189	Finally, any system applied to real input, no matter how carefully designed, will occasionally make errors in finding the verb and determining its subcategorizatiou frame." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:189	The more times a given verb appears in the corpus, the more likely it is that one of those occurrences will cause an erroneous judgment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:189	For that reason any learning system that gets only positive examples and makes a permanent judgment on a single example will always degrade as the number of occurrences increases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:189	In fact, making a judgment based on any fixed number of examples with any finite error rate will always lead to degradation with corpussize." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:189	A better approach is to require a fixed percentage of the total occurrences of any given verb to appear with a given SF before concluding that random error is not responsible for these observations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:189	Unfortunately, determining the cutoff percentage requires human intervention and sampling error makes classification unstable for verbs with few occurrences in the input." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:189	The sampling error can be dealt with (Brent, 1991) but predetermined cutoff percentages stir require eye-bailing the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:189	Thus robust, unsupervised judgments in the face of error pose the third challenge to developing an accurate learning system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:189	1.3 HOW IT'S DONE The architecture of the system, and that of this paper, directly reflects the three challenges described above." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:189	SF decision: Determines whether a verb is genuinely associated with a given SF, or whether instead its apparent occurrences in that SF are due to error." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="53:189	2 VERB DETECTION The technique I developed for finding verbs is based on the Case Filter of Rouvret and Verguaud (1980)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:189	The Case Filter is a proposed rule of grammar which, as it applies to English, says that every noun-phrase must appear either immediately to the left of a tensed verb, immediately to the right of a preposition, or immediately to the right of a main verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:189	Adverbs and adverbial phrases (including days and dates) are ignored for the purposes of case adjacency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:189	A noun-phrase that satisfies the Case Filter is said to 'get case' or 'have case', while one that violates it is said to 'lack case'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:189	The program judges an open-class word to be a main verb if it is adjacent to a pronoun or proper name that would otherwise lack case." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:189	Such a pronoun or proper name is either the subject or 210 the direct object of the verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:189	Other noun phrases are not used because it is too difficult to determine their right boundaries accurately." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:189	The two criteria for evaluating the performance of the main-verb detection technique are efficiency and accuracy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:189	Both were measured using a 2.6 million word corpus for which the Penn Treebank project provides hand-verified tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:189	Efficiency of verb detection was assessed by running the SF detection module in the normal mode, where verbs were detected using the Case Filter technique, and then running it again with the Penn Tags substituted for the verb detection module." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="119:189	The methods described above solve several important problems that had stood in the way of that goal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="120:189	Moreover, the results obtained with those methods are quite encouraging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:189	Nonetheless, two obvious barriers still stand on the path to a fully automated SF dictionary: a decision algorithm that can handle random error, and techniques for detecting many more types of SFs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:189	Algorithms are currently being developed to resolve raw SF observations into genuine lexical properties and random error." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="123:189	The idea is to automatically generate statistical models of the sources of error." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="124:189	For example, purpose adjuncts like 'John quit to pursue a career in finance' are quite rare, accounting for only two percent of the apparent infinitival complements." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="125:189	Furthermore, they are distributed across a much larger set of matrix verbs than the true infinitival complements, so any given verb should occur with a purpose adjunct extremely rarely." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="126:189	In a histogram sorting verbs by their apparent frequency of occurrence with infinitival complements, those that in fact have appeared with purpose adjuncts and not true subcategorized infinitives will be clustered at the low frequencies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="127:189	The distributions of such clusters can be modeled automatically and the models used for identifying false positives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="128:189	The second requirement for automatically generating a full-scale dictionary is the ability to detect many more types of SFs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="129:189	SFs involving certain prepositional phrases are particularly chal: lenging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="130:189	For example, while purpose adjuncts (mistaken for infinitival complements) are relatively rare, instrumental adjuncts as in 'John hit the nail with a hammer' are more common." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="131:189	The problem, of course, is how to distinguish them from genuine, subcategorized PPs headed by with, as in 'John sprayed the lawn with distilled water'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="132:189	The hope is that a frequency analysis like the one planned for purpose adjuncts will work here as well, but how successful it will be, and if successful how large a sample size it will require, remain to be seen." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="133:189	The question of sample size leads back to an evaluation of the initial priorities, which favored simplicity, speed, and accuracy, over efficient use of the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="134:189	There are various ways in which the high-priority criteria can be traded off against efficiency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="135:189	For example, consider (2c): one might expect that the overwhelming majority of occurrences of 'is V-ing' are genuine progressives, while a tiny minority are cases copula." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="136:189	One might also expect that the occasional copula constructions are not concentrated around any one present participle but rather distributed randomly among a large population." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="137:189	If those expectations are true then a frequency-modeling mechanism like the one being developed for adjuncts ought to prevent the mistaken copula from doing any harm." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="49:359	Most work on corpora of naturally occurring language 244 Michael R. Brent From Grammar to Lexicon either uses no a priori grammatical knowledge (Brill and Marcus 1992; Ellison 1991; Finch and Chater 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992), or else it relies on a large and complex grammar (Hindle 1990, 1991)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="64:359	The cues presented here are not intended to be the last word on local cues to structure in English; they are merely intended to illustrate the feasibility of such cues and demonstrate how the statistical model accommodates their probabilistic correspondence to the true syntactic structure of sentences." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="70:359	The second stage is necessary because of lexical ambiguity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:359	The first stage uses the fact that all English verbs can occur both with and without the suffix -ing." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="73:359	2 There are a few words that meet this criterion but do not occur as verbs, including income~incoming (,incame/incomed), ear~earring, her~herring, and middle~middling." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:359	However, the second stage of verb detection, combined with the statistical criteria, prevent these pairs from introducing errors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:359	1 Brill and Marcus (1992) use a single grammatical rule in the test phase to supplement the rules their system learns, but no grammatical knowledge is used in the learning phase." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="80:359	In particular, an occurrence of a potential verb is taken as a nonverbal occurrence only if it follows a determiner or a preposition other than to." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:359	For example, was talking would be taken as a verb, but a talk would not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:359	This precaution reduces the likelihood that a singular count noun will be mistaken for a verb, since singular count nouns are frequently preceded by a determiner." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:359	Finally, the only morphological forms that are used for learning syntactic frames are the stem form and the -ing form." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:359	There are several reasons for this." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:359	First, forms ending in -s are potentially ambiguous between third person singular present verbs and plural nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:359	Since plural nouns are not necessarily preceded by determiners (I like to take walks), they could pose a significant ambiguity problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:359	Second, past participles do not generally take direct objects: knows me and knew me are OK, but not  is known me. Further, the past tense and past participle forms of some verbs are identical, while those of others are distinct." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:359	As a result, using the -ed forms would have complicated the statistical model substantially." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:359	Since the availability of raw text is not generally a limiting factor, it makes sense to wait for the simpler cases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:359	2.2 Identifying Argument Phrases When a putative occurrence of a verb is found, the next step is to identify the syntactic types of nearby phrases and determine whether or not they are likely to be arguments of the verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:359	First, assume that a phrase P and a verb V have been identified in some sentence." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="95:359	Regardless of P's category, take it as an argument only if it occurs to the right of V and there are no potential attachment points for P between V and P. For example, suppose that the sequence that the were identified as the left boundary of a clause in the sentence I want to tell him that the idea won'tfly." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:359	Because pronouns like him almost never take relative clauses, and because pronouns are known at the outset, Lerner concludes that the clause beginning with that the is probably an argument of the verb tell." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:359	3 It is always possible that it could be an argument of the previous verb want, but Lerner treats that as unlikely." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:359	On the other hand, if the sentence were I want to tell the boss that the idea won'tfly, then Lerner cannot determine whether the clause beginning with that the is an argument to tell or is instead related to boss, as in I want to fire the boss that the workers don't trust." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:359	Now consider specific cues for identifying argument phrases." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="299:359	4.1 Other Syntactic Frames The lexical entry of a verb can specify other syntactic frames in addition to the six studied here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="300:359	In particular, many verbs take prepositional phrases (PPs) headed by a particular preposition or class of prepositions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="306:359	The problem, however, is determining which PPs are arguments and which are adjuncts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="307:359	There are clearly cases where a prepositional phrase can occur in a clause not by virtue of the lexical entry of the verb but rather by virtue of nonlexical facts of English syntax." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="308:359	For instance, almost any verb can occur with a temporal PP headed by on, as in John arrived on Monday." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="309:359	Such PPs are called adjuncts." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="312:359	If anything significant is to be learned about individual words, the nonspecific cooccurrences of verbs with PPs (adjuncts) must be separated from the specific ones (arguments)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="322:359	Second, it does not take into account the fact that for some words with verbal senses most of their occurrences are verbal, whereas for others most of their occurrences are nonverbal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="323:359	For example, operate occurs exclusively as a verb while board occurs much more often as a noun than as a verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="324:359	Since the cues are based on the assumption that the word in question is a verb, board presents many more opportunities for error than operate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="325:359	This violates the assumption that the probability of error for a given frame is approximately uniform across verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="326:359	6 The preposition/particle distinction is set aside here in order to focus on the more problematic argument/adjunct distinction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="327:359	257 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Table 9 Distribution of occurrences among morphological forms in the Brown Corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="330:359	For example, an applied system can be provided with the rough estimates that 80-95 percent of verbs take a direct object, while 1-2 percent take a direct object followed by a tensed clause." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="331:359	Such estimates can be expected to reduce misclassification significantly." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="332:359	Further, an existing dictionary could be used to 'train' a statistical model on familiar verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="333:359	A trained system would probably be more accurate in classifying new verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="334:359	Finally, the lexical ambiguity problem could probably be reduced substantially in the applied context by using a statistical tagging program (Brill 1992; Church 1988)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="335:359	For addressing basic questions in machine learning of natural language the solutions outlined above are not attractive." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="336:359	All of those solutions provide the learner with additional specific knowledge of English, whereas the goal for the machine learning effort should be to replace specific knowledge with general knowledge about the types of regularities to be found in natural language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="337:359	There is one approach to the lexical ambiguity problem that does not require giving the learner additional specific knowledge." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="338:359	The problem is as follows: words that occur frequently as, say, nouns are likely to have a different error rate from unambiguous verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="339:359	If it were known which words occur primarily as verbs and which occur primarily as nouns then separate error rate estimates could be made for each." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="340:359	This would reduce the rate of false positive errors even without any further information about which particular occurrences are nominal and which are verbal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="341:359	One way to distinguish primarily nominal words from primarily verbal words is by the relative frequencies of their various inflected forms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="342:359	For example, Table 9 shows the contrast in the distribution of inflected forms between project and board on the one hand and operate and follow on the other." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="343:359	Project and board are two words whose frequent occurrence as nouns has caused Lerner to make false positive errors." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="50:156	The main problem with using probability theory for problems in document classification is that while it might be relatively easy to estimate probabilities such as P(dlw ) for some diagnostic unit w and some descriptor d, it is not possible 66 to infer much about P(dIw~), where  is some additional information (e.g. the other DUs which represent the document), since these probabilities have not been estimated, and would take a far larger corpus to reliably estimate in any case." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="54:156	The strategy explored here is to concentrate on finding 'sure-fire' indicators of descriptors, in a somewhat similar manner to how Carnegie's TCS works, by exploiting the fact that with a preclassified training corpus we can identify sure-fire indicators empirically and 'trawl' in a large set of informative diagnostic units for those which identify descriptors with high precision." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:156	The basis of the model is the following: We consider a likelihood function, Z: defined by: Z(dlw) = gd~ N~ That is, the number of articles in the training corpus that d was observed to occur with w divided by the number of articles in which w occurred in the training corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="66:156	at least 1 Proof: \[Straight-forward and omitted\] This proposition asserts that one cannot be guaranteed to be able to keep adding diagnostic units to improve recall without hurting precision, unless the 67 quality of those diagnostic units is also improved (i.e. c is decreased in proportion to the number of DUs which are considered)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:156	This is unfortunate, but nevertheless the question of how much adding diagnostic units to help recall will hurt precision is an entirely empirical matter dependent on the true nature of P; this proposition is a worst case, and gives us reason to be careful." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="71:156	In practice, this is infeasible, but it is feasible to look more carefully at frequently co-occurring predicates, since these will be most likely to reduce precision." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:156	1 The main moral we can draw from the above two propositions is that we must be careful about the case where diagnostic units are highly correlated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:156	One situation which is relatively frequent as the sophistication of representation increases is that some diagnostic units always co-occur with others." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:156	For example, if the document were represented by sequences of words, then the sequence 'olefin polymerisation' always occurs whenever the sequence 'high temperature olefin polymerisation' occurs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:156	In this case, it might be thought to pay to look only at the most specific diagnostic units since we have if wl --* w2, then P(Z\]wlw2C) = P(XIwlC) for any distribution P whatsoever (here, C represents any other contextual information we have, for example the other diagnostic units representing the document)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:156	However, if wl is significantly less frequent than w2 estimation errors of P(d\[wl) will be larger for P(dlw2) for any descriptor d, so there may not be a significant advantage." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="78:156	In a collection of New York Times articles studied by Jacobs & Rau (1990), the word 'Yankee' was found to predict NUCLEAR POWER because of the frequent occurrence of articles about this plant." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="80:156	If highly mutually informative words 'are combined into conjunctive predicates (e.g. 'Yankee' E x & 'Plant' E x), and a document is represented by its most specific predicates only, then when 'Yankee' appears alone, it will be a good predictor of the descriptor SPORT." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:156	This example can also show that the bound described above is tight." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="685:730	This result may raise relevant hypotheses for psycholinguistic research, which has indicated the relevance of word frequencies to human sense disambiguation (e.g. , Simpson and Burgess 1988)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="686:730	We suggest that the high precision achieved in the experiments relies on two characteristics of the ambiguity phenomena, namely the sparseness and redundancy of the disambiguating data." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="689:730	Redundancy relates to the fact that different informants (such as different lexical relations or deep understanding) tend to support rather than contradict one another, and therefore the chance of picking a 'wrong' informant is low." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="695:730	It seems, however, that Brown et al. expect that target word selection would be determined mainly by translation probabilities (the second factor in the above term), which should be derived from a bilingual corpus (Brown et al. 1990, p. 79)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:166	There are two reasons for this that I will discuss briefly here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:166	First, the problem of multiple reference." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:166	The head of the NP (book) has a number of systematically related senses that are being expressed simultaneously." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:166	The meaning of book in this sentence cannot be disambiguated between the number of interpretations that are implied: the informational content of the book (military technicalities), its physical appearance (heavily weighted) and the events that are involved in its construction and use (long)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:166	The example illustrates the fact that disambiguation between related senses is not always possible, which leads to the further question if a discrete distinction between such senses is desirable at all." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:166	A number of researchers have answered this question negatively (see eg: (Pustejovsky, 1995) (Killgariff, 1992))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:166	Consider these examples from BROWN: (1) fast run-up (of the stock) (2) fast action (by the city government) (3) fast footwork (by Washington) (4) fast weight gaining (5) fast condition (of the track) (6) fast response time (7) fast people (8) fast ball Each use of the adjective 'fast' in these examples has a slightly different interpretation that could be captured in a number of senses, reflecting the different syntactic and semantic patterns." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="20:166	It seems therefore useful to underspecify the lexical meaning of 'fast' to a representation that captures this primary semantic aspect and gives a general structure for its combination with other lexical items, both locally (in compositional semantics) and globally (in discourse structure)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:166	Both the multiple reference and the sense enumeration problem show that lexical items mostly have an indefinite number of related but highly discourse dependent interpretations, between which cannot be distinguished by semantic tagging alone." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:389	Various corpus-based approaches to word sense disambiguation have been proposed (Bruce and Wiebe 1994; Charniak 1993; Dagan and Itai 1994; Fujii et al. 1996; Hearst 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Ng and Lee 1996; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Sch~itze 1992; Uramoto 1994b; Yarowsky 1995)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:389	The use of corpus-based approaches has grown with the use of machine-readable text, because unlike conventional rule-based approaches relying on hand-crafted selectional rules (some of which are reviewed, for example, by Hirst \[1987\]), corpus-based approaches release us from the task of generalizing observed phenomena through a set of rules." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:389	As with most example-based systems (Fujii et al. 1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Uramoto 1994b), our system uses an example database (database, hereafter) that contains example sentences associated with each verb sense." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="22:389	Therefore, in order to build an operational system, the following problems have to be taken into account1: given human resource limitations, it is not reasonable to supervise every example in large corpora ('overhead for supervision'), given the fact that example-based systems, including our system, search the database for the examples most similar to the input, the computational cost becomes prohibitive if one works with a very large database size ('overhead for search')." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:249	Our contributions are three-fold: an empirical comparison of a broad range of measures; a classification of similarity functions based on the information that they incorporate; and the introduction of a novel function that is superior at evaluating potential proxy distributions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:249	1 Introduction An inherent problem for statistical methods in natural language processing is that of sparse data -the inaccurate representation in any training corpus of the probability of low frequency events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:249	In particular, reasonable events that happen to not occur in the training set may mistakenly be assigned a probability of zero." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:249	These unseen events generally make up a substantial portion of novel data; for example, Essen and Steinbiss (1992) report that 12% of the test-set bigrams in a 75%-25% split of one million words did not occur in the training partition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:249	We consider here the question of how to estimate the conditional cooccurrence probability P(v\[n) of an unseen word pair (n, v) drawn from some finite set N x V. Two state-of-the-art technologies are Katz's (1987) backoff method and Jelinek and Mercer's (1980) interpolation method." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:249	Both use P(v) to estimate P(v\[n) when (n, v) is unseen, essentially ignoring the identity of n. An alternative approach is distance-weighted averaging, which arrives at an estimate for unseen cooccurrences by combining estimates for 25 cooccurrences involving similar words: 1 /P(v\[n) ---~-~mES(n) sim(n, m)P(v\[m) ~-\]mES(n) sim(n, m), (1) where S(n) is a set of candidate similar words and sim(n, m) is a function of the similarity between n and m. We focus on distributional rather than semantic similarity (e.g. , Resnik (1995)) because the goal of distance-weighted averaging is to smooth probability distributions -although the words 'chance' and 'probability' are synonyms, the former may not be a good model for predicting what cooccurrences the latter is likely to participate in." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:249	There are many plausible measures of distributional similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:249	In previous work (Dagan et al. , 1999), we compared the performance of three different functions: the Jensen-Shannon divergence (total divergence to the average), the L1 norm, and the confusion probability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:249	Our experiments on a frequency-controlled pseudoword disambiguation task showed that using any of the three in a distance-weighted averaging scheme yielded large improvements over Katz's backoff smoothing method in predicting unseen coocurrences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:249	Furthermore, by using a restricted version of model (1) that stripped incomparable parameters, we were able to empirically demonstrate that the confusion probability is fundamentally worse at selecting useful similar words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:249	D. Lin also found that the choice of similarity function can affect the quality of automatically-constructed thesauri to a statistically significant degree (1998a) and the ability to determine common morphological roots by as much as 49% in precision (1998b)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:249	1The term 'similarity-based', which we have used previously, has been applied to describe other models as well (L. Lee, 1997; Karov and Edelman, 1998)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:249	These empirical results indicate that investigating different similarity measures can lead to improved natural language processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:249	On the other hand, while there have been many similarity measures proposed and analyzed in the information retrieval literature (Jones and Furnas, 1987), there has been some doubt expressed in that community that the choice of similarity metric has any practical impact: Several authors have pointed out that the difference in retrieval performance achieved by different measures of association is insignificant, providing that these are appropriately normalised." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:249	(van Rijsbergen, 1979, pg." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:249	38) But no contradiction arises because, as van Rijsbergen continues, 'one would expect this since most measures incorporate the same information'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:249	In the language-modeling domain, there is currently no agreed-upon best similarity metric because there is no agreement on what the 'same information'the key data that a similarity function should incorporate -is. The overall goal of the work described here was to discover these key characteristics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:249	To this end, we first compared a number of common similarity measures, evaluating them in a parameter-free way on a decision task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:249	When grouped by average performance, they fell into several coherent classes, which corresponded to the extent to which the functions focused on the intersection of the supports (regions of positive probability) of the distributions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="22:249	This function yielded the best performance overall: an average error rate reduction of 4% (significant at the.01 level) with respect to the Jensen-Shannon divergence, the best predictor of unseen events in our earlier experiments (Dagan et al. , 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:249	Our contributions are thus three-fold: an empirical comparison of a broad range of similarity metrics using an evaluation methodology that factors out inessential degrees of freedom; a proposal, building on this comparison, of a characteristic for classifying similarity functions; and the introduction of a new similarity metric incorporating this characteristic that is superior at evaluating potential proxy distributions." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="7:132	To extract semantic information of words such as synonyms and antonyms from corpora, previous research used syntactic structures (Hindle 1990, Hatzivassiloglou 1993 and Tokunaga 1995), response time to associate synonyms and antonyms in psychological experiments (Gross 1989), or extracting related words automatically from corpora (Grefensette 1994)." ></td>

The head noun, kimochi (feeling), is a cognate object for kanashii (sad) and yorokobi no (delight + no). Therefore, even though kanashii (sad) and yorokobi no (delight + no) belong to different parts of speech (adjective and noun phrase), they must be classified as the same semantic category, since both carry the same type of meaning." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="5:158	1 Introduction Distributional Similarity has been an active research area for more than a decade (Hindle, 1990), (Ruge, 1992), (Grefenstette, 1994), (Lee, 1997), (Lin, 1998), (Dagan et al. , 1999), (Weeds and Weir, 2003)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:158	Inspired by Harris distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968), similarity measures compare a pair of weighted feature vectors that characterize two words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:158	Features typically correspond to other words that co-occur with the characterized word in the same context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:158	It is then assumed that different words that occur within similar contexts are semantically similar." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:158	As it turns out, distributional similarity captures a somewhat loose notion of semantic similarity (see Table 1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:158	By construction, if two words are distributionally similar then the occurrence of one word in some contexts indicates that the other word is also likely to occur in such contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:158	But it does not ensure that the meaning of the first word is preserved when replacing it with the other one in the given context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:158	For example, words of similar semantic types, such as company government, tend to come up as distributionally similar, even though they are not substitutable in a meaning preserving sense." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:158	On the other hand, many semantic-oriented applications, such as Question Answering, Paraphrasing and Information Extraction, do need to recognize which words may substitute each other in a meaning preserving manner." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:158	For example, a question about company may be answered by a sentence about firm, but not about government." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:158	Such applications usually utilize reliable taxonomies or ontologies like WordNet, but cannot rely on the loose type of output of distributional similarity measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:158	In recent work Dagan and Glickman (2004) observe that applications usually do not require a strict meaning preserving criterion between text expressions, but rather need to recognize that the meaning of one expression entails the other." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:158	Entailment modeling is thus proposed in their work as a generic (application-independent) framework for practical semantic inference." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:158	We suggest adopting such (directional) entailment criterion at the lexical level for judging whether one word can be substituted by another one." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:158	For example, certain questions about companies might be answered by sentences about automakers, since the meaning of automaker entails the meaning of company (though not vice versa)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:158	In this paper we adapt this new criterion, termed meaning entailing substitutability, as a direct evaluation criterion for the 'correctness' of the output of word similarity measures (as opposed to indirect evaluations through WSD or distance in WordNet)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:158	Our eventual research goal is improving word similarity measures to predict better the more delicate meaning entailment relationship between words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:158	As a first step it was necessary to analyze the typical behavior of current similarity measures and categorize their errors (Section 3)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="25:158	is often hurt by improper feature weights, which yield rather noisy feature vectors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:158	We quantify this problem by a new measure for feature vector quality, which is independent of any particular vector similarity measure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:158	To improve feature vector quality a novel feature weighting function is introduced, called relative feature focus (RFF) (Section 4)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:158	While having a simple (though non-standard) definition, this function yields improved performance relative to the two suggested evaluation criteria for vector quality and for word similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:158	The underlying idea is that a good characteristic feature for a word w should characterize also multiple words that are highly similar to w. In other words, such feature should have a substantial 'focus' within the close semantic vicinity of w. Applying RFF weighting achieved about 10% improvement in predicting meaning entailing substitutability (Section 5)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:158	Further analysis shows that RFF also leads to 'cleaner' characteristic feature vectors, which may be useful for additional feature-based tasks like clustering." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:158	2 Background and Definitions In the distributional similarity scheme each word w is represented by a feature vector, where an entry in the vector corresponds to a feature f. Each feature represents another word (or term) with which w co-occurs, and possibly specifies also the syntactic relation between the two words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:158	The value of each entry is determined by some weight function weight(w,f), which quantifies the degree of statistical association between the feature and the corresponding word." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="77:158	Then, we define the word set of a feature f, denoted by WS(f), as the set of words for which f is an active feature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:158	The semantic neighborhood of w, denoted by N(w), is defined as the set of all words v which are considered sufficiently similar to w, satisfying sim(w,v)>s where s is a threshold (0.04 in our experiments)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:158	RFF is then defined by:  = ),(),( )()( vwsimfwRFF wNfWSv." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:158	That is, we identify all words v that are in the semantic neighborhood of w and are also characterized by f and sum their similarities to w.

Instead, it depends on a more global assessment of the association between f and the semantic vicinity of w.

	<td class="line x" title="83:158	Some features might characterize just a single word that is very similar to w.

	<td class="line x" title="11:196	Also, the words dog, computer and company all have a sense that is a hyponym of person." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:196	Such rare senses make it difficult for a coreference resolution system to use WordNet to enforce the constraint that personal pronouns (e.g. he or she) must refer to a person." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:196	The second problem with these lexicons is that they miss many domain specific senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:196	For example, WordNet misses the user-interface-object sense of the word dialog (as often used in software manuals)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:196	WordNet also contains a very poor coverage of proper nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:196	There is a need for (semi-) automatic approaches to building and extending ontologies as well as for validating the structure and content of existing ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:196	With the advent of the Web, we have access to enormous amounts of text." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:160	1 Introduction Over the past decade, there has been tremendous progress on learning parsing models from treebank data (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Wang et al. , 2005; McDonald et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:160	Most of the early work in this area was based on postulating generative probability models of language that included parse structure (Collins, 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:160	Learning in this context consisted of estimating the parameters of the model with simple likelihood based techniques, but incorporating various smoothing and back-off estimation tricks to cope with the sparse data problems (Collins, 1997; Bikel, 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:160	Subsequent research began to focus more on conditional models of parse structure given the input sentence, which allowed discriminative training techniques such as maximum conditional likelihood (i.e. maximum entropy ) to be applied (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Charniak, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:160	In fact, recently, effective conditional parsing models have been learned using relatively straightforward plug-in estimates, augmented with similarity based smoothing (Wang et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:160	Currently, the work on conditional parsing models appears to have culminated in large margin training (Taskar et al. , 2003; Taskar et al. , 2004; Tsochantaridis et al. , 2004; McDonald et al. , 2005), which currently demonstrates the state of the art performance in English dependency parsing (McDonald et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:160	Despite the realization that maximum margin training is closely related to maximum conditional likelihood for conditional models (McDonald et al. , 2005), a suf ciently uni ed view has not yet been achieved that permits the easy exchange of improvements between the probabilistic and nonprobabilistic approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:160	For example, smoothing methods have played a central role in probabilistic approaches (Collins, 1997; Wang et al. , 2005), and yet they are not being used in current large margin training algorithms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:160	However, as we demonstrate, not only can smoothing be applied in a large margin training framework, it leads to generalization improvements in much the same way as probabilistic approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:160	The second key observation we make is somewhat more subtle." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:160	It turns out that probabilistic approaches pay closer attention to the individual errors made by each component of a parse, whereas the training error minimized in the large margin approach the structured margin loss (Taskar et al. , 2003; Tsochantaridis et al. , 2004; McDonald et al. , 2005) is a coarse measure that only assesses the total error of an entire parse rather than focusing on the error of any particular component." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="21:160	Second, we show that the large margin training objective can be signi cantly re ned to assess the error of each component of a given parse, rather than just assess a global score." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:160	Of course, training a parser with bare word-toword relationships presents a serious challenge due to data sparseness." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="41:160	Its performance was close to the state of the art lexicalized parsers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:160	Nevertheless, in this paper we follow the recent work of (Wang et al. , 2005) and consider a completely lexicalized parser that uses no parts-ofspeech or grammatical categories of any kind." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:160	Dependency trees are usually assumed to be projective (no crossing arcs), which means that if there is an arc a4a6a5a27a20a25a21a28a5a25a24a29a17, then a5a16a20 is an ancestor of all the words between a5a30a20 and a5a25a24 . Let a31a32a4a33a2a34a17 denote the set of all the directed, projective trees that span a2 . Given an input sentence a2, we would like to be able to compute the best parse; that is, a projective tree, a19a36a35 a31a32a4a33a2a34a17, that obtains the highest score . In particular, we follow (Eisner, 1996; Eisner and Satta, 1999; McDonald et al. , 2005) and assume that the score of a complete spanning tree a19 for a given sentence, whether probabilistically motivated or not, can be decomposed as a sum of local scores for each link (a word pair)." ></td>

This formulation is suf ciently general to capture most dependency parsing models, including probabilistic dependency models (Wang et al. , 2005; Eisner, 1996) as well as non-probabilistic models (McDonald et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:160	For standard scoring functions, parsing requires an a72a58a4a6a73a75a74a12a17 dynamic programming algorithm to compute a projective tree that obtains the maximum score (Eisner and Satta, 1999; Wang et al. , 2005; McDonald et al. , 2005)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:114	To measure the semantic relatedness of words, a concept called distributional similarity has been widely used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:114	Distributional similarity represents the relatedness of two words by the commonality of contexts the words share, based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1985), which states that semantically similar words share similar contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line pc" title="10:114	A wide range of contextual information, such as surrounding words (Lowe and McDonald, 2000; Curran and Moens, 2002a), dependency or case structure (Hindle, 1990; Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998), and dependency path (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pado and Lapata, 2007), has been utilized for similarity calculation, and achieved considerable success." ></td>
	<td class="line n" title="11:114	However, amajorproblemwhichariseswhenadopting distributional similarity is that it easily yields a huge amount of unique contexts." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="13:114	Because not all of the contexts are useful, it is strongly required for the efciency to eliminate the unwanted contexts to ease the expensive cost." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:114	To tackle this issue, Curran and Moens (2002b) suggest assigning an index vector of canonical attributes, i.e., a small number of representative elements extracted from the original vector, to each word." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="17:114	There are also some existing studies which paid attention to the comparison of context categories for synonym acquisition (Curran and Moens, 2002a; Hagiwara et al., 2006)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:114	Therefore, general quantitative measures which can be used for reduction and selection of any kind of contexts and context categories are strongly required." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:114	Shifting our attention from word similarity to other areas, a great deal of studies on feature selection has been conducted in the literature, especially for text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997) and gene expression classication (Ding and Peng, 2003)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="22:114	In this paper, we rstly introduce existing quantitative methods for feature selection, namely, DF, TS, MI, IG, CHI2, and show how to apply them to the distributional similarity problem to measure the context importance." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="33:114	It is to note, however, that the contexts with too high DF are not always useful, since there are some exceptions including so-called stopwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:114	2.2 Term Strength (TS) Term strength (TS), proposed by Wilbur and Sirotkin (1992) and applied to text categorization by Yang and Wilbur (1996), measures how likely a term is to appear in  similar documents, and it is shown to achieve a successful outcome in reducing the amount of vocabulary for text retrieval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:114	For distributional similarity, TS is dened as: s(c) = P(c  C(w2)|c  C(w1)), where (w1,w2) is a related word pair and C(w) is a set of contexts co-occurring with the word w, i.e., C(w) = {c|N(w,c) > 0}." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:114	s(c) is calculated, letting PH be a set of related word pairs, as s(c) = |{(w1,w2)  PH|c  C(w1) C(w2)}||{(w 1,w2)  PH|c  C(w1)}| . What makes TS different from DF is that it requires a training set PH consisting of related word pairs." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="38:114	2.3 Formalization of Distributional Similarity The following methods, MI, IG, and CHI2, are radically different from the above ones, in that they are 554 designed essentially for  class classication problems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:114	Thus we formalize distributional similarity as a classication problem as described below." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="43:114	These dened, distributional similarity is formalized as a binary classication problem which assigns the word pairs to the class s  {0,1} based on the features c1,,cm." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:114	Finally, to calculate the specic values of the following feature importance measures, we prepare two test sets of related word pairs for class s = 1 and unrelated ones for class s = 0." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:114	This enables us to apply existing feature selection methods designed for classication problems to the automatic context selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:114	The two test sets, related and unrelated one, are prepared using the reference sets described in Section 4." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:114	More specically, we created 5,000 related word pairs by extracting from synonym pairs in the referenceset,and5,000unrelatedonesbyrstlycreatingrandompairsofLDV,whosedetailisdescribed later, and then manually making sure that no related pairs are included in these random pairs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:114	2.4 Mutual Information (MI) Mutual information (MI), commonly used for word association and co-occurrence weighing in statistical NLP, is the measure of the degree of dependence between two events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:114	The pointwise MI value of feature f and class s is calculated as: I(f,s) = log P(f,s)P(f)P(s)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:251	In particular, a long-standing challenge has been to correctly classify instances of the English pronoun it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:251	Consider the sentences: (1) You can make it in advance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:251	(2) You can make it in Hollywood." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:251	As with other pronouns, the preceding discourse can affect its interpretation." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:83	We contrast this method with two popular approaches to retrieving this information and show that it improves the performance of our VSD system and outperforms the other two approaches 1 Introduction The task of Verb Sense Disambiguation (VSD) consists in automatically assigning a sense to a verb (target verb) given its context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:83	In a supervised setting, a VSD system is usually trained on a set of pre-labeled examples; the goal of this system is to tag unseen examples with a sense from some sense inventory." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:83	An automatic VSD system usually has at its disposal a diverse set of features among which the semantic features play an important role: verb sense distinctions often depend on the distinctions in the semantics of the target verb's arguments (Hanks, 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:83	Therefore, some method of capturing the semantic knowledge about the verb's arguments is crucial to the success of a VSD system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:83	The approaches to obtaining this kind of knowledge can be based on extracting it from ele ctronic dictionaries such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), using Named Entity (NE) tags, or a combination of both (Chen, 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:83	In this paper, we propose a novel method for obtaining semantic knowledge about words and show how it can be applied to VSD." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:83	We contrast this method with the other two approaches and compare their performances in a series of experiments." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:83	2 Lexical and Syntactic Features We view VSD as a supervised learning problem, solving which requires three groups of features: lexical, syntactic, and semantic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:83	Lexical features include all open class words; we extract them from the target sentence and the two surrounding sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:83	We also use as features two words on the right and on the left of the target verb as well as their POS tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:83	We extract syntactic features from constituency parses; they indicate whether the target verb has a subject/object and what their head words and POS tags are, whether the target verb is in a passive or active form, whether the target verb has a subordinate clause, and whether the target verb has a PP adjunct." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:83	Additionally, we implement several new syntactic features, which have not been used in VSD before: the path through the parse tree from the target verb to the verb's arguments and the subcategorization frame, as used in semantic role labeling." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:83	3 Semantic Features Consider the verb prepare for which our sense inventory defines two senses: (1) to put together, assemble (e.g. He is going to prepare breakfast for the whole crowd ; I haven't prepared my lecture 29 yet); (2) to make ready (e.g. She prepared the children for school every morning)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:83	Knowing the semantic class of the objects breakfast, lecture and children is the decisive factor in distinguishing the two senses and facilitates better generalization from the training data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:83	One way to obtain this knowledge is from Wor dNet (WN) or from the output of a NE-tagger." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:83	However, both approaches suffer from the same limitation: they collapse multiple semantic properties of nouns into a finite number of predefined static classes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:83	E.g., the most immediate hypernym of breakfast in WN is meal, while the most immediate hypernym of lecture is address, which makes these two nouns unrelated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:83	Yet, breakfast and lecture are both social events which share some semantic properties: they both can be attended, hosted, delivered, given, held, organized etc. To discover these class-like descriptions of nouns, one can observe which verbs take these nouns as objects." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:83	E.g. breakfast can serve as the object of serve, host, attend, and cook  which are all indicative of breakfast's semantic properties." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:83	Given a noun, we can dynamically retrieve other verbs that take that noun as an object from a dependency-parsed corpus; we call this kind of data Dynamic Dependency Neighbors  (DDNs) because it is obtained dynamically and based on the dependency relations in the neighborhood of the noun of interest." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:83	The top 501 DDNs can be viewed as a reliable inventory of semantic properties of the noun." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:83	To collect this data, we utilized two resources: (1) MaltParser (Nivre, 2007)  a high-efficiency dependency parser; (2) English Gigaword  a large corpus of 5.7M news articles." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:83	We preprocessed Gigaword with MaltParser, extracted all pairs of nouns and verbs that were parsed as participants of the object-verb relation, and counted the frequency of occurrence of all the unique pa irs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:83	Finally, we indexed the resulting records of the form <frequency, verb, object> using the Lucene2 indexing engine." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:83	As an example, consider four nouns: dinner, breakfast, lecture, child." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:83	When used as the objects of prepare, the first three of them correspond to the instances of the sense 1 of prepare; the fourth one  1 In future, we will try to optimize this parameter 2 Available at http://lucene.apache.org/ corresponds to an instance of the sense 2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:83	With the help of our index, we can retrieve their DDNs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:83	There is a considerable overlap among the DDNs of the first three nouns and a much smaller overlap between child  and the first three nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:83	E.g., dinner and breakfast have 34 DDNs in common, while dinner and child  only share 14." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:83	Once we have set up the framework for the extraction of DDNs, the algorithm for applying them to VSD is straightforward: (1) find the noun object of the ambiguous verb (2) extract the DDNs for that noun (3) sort the DDNs by frequency and keep the top 50 (4) include these DDNs in the feature vector so that each of the extracted verbs becomes a separate feature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:83	4 Relevant Work At the core of our work lies the notion of distrib utional similarity (Harris, 1968), which states that similar words occur in similar contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:83	In various sources, the notion of context ranges from bag-ofwords-like approaches to more structured ones in which syntax plays a role." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:83	Schutze (1998) used bag-of-words contexts for sense discrimination." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="36:83	Hindle (1990) grouped nouns into thesaurus-like lists based on the similarity of their syntactic contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:83	Our approach is similar with the difference that we do not group noun arguments into finite categories, but instead leave the category boundaries blurry and allow overlaps." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:83	The DDNs are essentially a form of world knowledge which we extract automatically and apply to VSD." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:83	Other researches attacked the problem of unsupervised extraction of world know ledge: Schubert (2003) reports a method for extracting general facts about the world from treebanked Brown corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:83	Lin and Pantel in (2001) describe their DIRT system for extraction of paraphrase-like inference rules." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:83	5 Evaluation We selected a subset of the verbs annotated in the OntoNotes project (Chen, 2007) that had at least 50 instances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:83	The resulting data set consisted of 46,577 instances of 217 verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:83	The predominant sense baseline for this data is 68%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:83	We used 30 libsvm3 for classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:83	We computed the accuracy and error rate using 5-fold cross-validation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:83	5.1 Experiments with a limited set of features The main objective of this experiment was to isolate the effect of the novel semantic features we proposed in this paper, i.e. the DDN features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:83	Toward that goal, we stripped our system of all the features but the most essential ones to investigate whether the DDN features would have a clearly positive or negative impact on the system performance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:83	Lexical features are the most essential to our system: a model that includes only the lexical features achieves an accuracy of 80.22, while the accuracy of our full-blown VSD system is 82.88%4." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:83	Since the DDN features have no effect when the object is not present, we identified 18,930 instances where the target verb had an object (about 41% of all instances) and used only them in the experiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:83	We built three models that included (1) the lexical features only (2) the lexical and the DDN features (3) the lexical and the object features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:83	The object features consist of the head word of the NP object and the head word's POS tag." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:83	The object is included since extracting the DDN features requires knowledge of the object; therefore the performance of a model that only includes lexical features cannot be considered a fair baseline for studying the effect of the DDN features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:83	Results are in Table 4." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:83	Features Included in Model Accuracy, % Error Rate, % Lexical 78.95 21.05 Lexical + Object  79.34 20.66 Lexical + DDN 82.40 17.60  Table 4." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:83	Experiments with object instances  As we see, the model that includes the DDN features performs more than 3 percentage points better than the model that only includes the object features (approximately 15% reduction in error rate)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:83	Also, based on the comparison of the performance of the 'lexical features only' and the 'lexical + DDN' models, we can claim that the  3 http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ 4 Given this high baseline, we include error rate when reporting the results of the experiments as it is more informative knowledge of the DDNs provides richer semantic knowledge than just the knowledge of the object's head word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:83	5.2 Integrating the DDN features into a fullfledged VSD system The objective of this experiment was to investigate whether the DDN features improve the performance of a full-fledged VSD system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:83	We built two models which consisted of (1) the entire set of features (2) all the features of the first model exclu ding the DDN features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:83	The entire data set (46K instances) participated in the experiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:83	Results are in Table 5." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="62:83	Performance of the full-fledged VSD system  The DDN features improved performance by 0.5% (3% drop in error rate)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:83	The difference between the accuracies is statistically significant (p=0.05)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:83	5.3 Relative Contribution of Various Semantic Fe atures The goal of this experiment was to study the relative contribution of various semantic features to the performance of our VSD system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:83	We built five models each of which, in addition to the lexical and syntactic features, included only certain type(s) of semantic feature: (1) WN (2) NE (3) WN and NE (4) DDN (5) no semantic features (baseline)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:83	All 46K instances participated in the experiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:83	The results are shown in Table 6." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="69:83	Relative Contribution of Semantic Features  The DDN features outperform the other two types of semantic features used separately and in conjunction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:83	The difference in performance is statistically significant (p=0.05)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:83	31 6 Discussion and Conclusion As we saw, the novel semantic features we proposed are beneficial to the task of VSD: they resulted in a decrease in error rate from 3% to 15%, depending on the particular experiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:83	We also discovered that the DDN features contributed twice as much as the other two types of semantic features combined: adding the WN and NE features to the baseline resulted in about a 3% decrease in error rate, while adding the DDN features caused a more than 6% drop." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:83	Our results suggest that DDNs duplicate the effect of WN and NE: our system achieved the same performance when all three types of semantic features were used and when we discarded WN and NE features and kept only the DDNs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:83	This finding is important because such resources as WN and NE-taggers are domain and language specific while the DDNs have the advantage of being obtainable from a large collection of texts in the domain or language of interest." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:83	Thus, the DDNs can become a crucial part of building a robust VSD system for a resource-poor domain or language, given a high-accuracy parser." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:83	7 Future Work In this paper we only experimented with verbs' objects, however the concept of DDNs can be easily extended to other arguments of the target verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:83	Also, we only utilized the object-verb relation in the dependency parses, but the range of potentially useful relations does not have to be limited only to it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:83	Finally, we used as features the 50 most frequent verbs that took the noun argument as an object." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:83	However, the raw frequency is certainly not the only way to rank the verbs; we plan on exploring other metrics such as Mutual Information." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:224	For example, idioms can violate selectional restrictions (as in push ones luck under the assumption that only concrete things can normally be pushed), disobey typical subcategorisation constraints (e.g., in line without a determiner before line), or change the default assignments of semantic roles to syntactic categories (e.g., in break sth with X the argument X would typically be an instrument but for the idiom break the ice it is more likely to fill a patient role, as in break the ice with Russia)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="127:224	The idioms were more or less selected randomly, subject to two constraints: First, because the focus of the present study is on distinguishing literal and non-literal usage, we chose expressions for which we assumed that the literal meaning was not too infrequent." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="136:224	Second, we wanted to test whether our approach would be able to detect literal usages in the set of canonical form expressions as this is precisely the set of expressions that would be classified as idiomatic by the unsupervised CForm classifier (Cook et al.(2007), Fazly et al.(To appear))." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:163	Our method primarily exploits the patterns in sentential contexts where different categories of words may appear." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:163	Experimental results are presented showing that such automatically categorized terms tend to agree with human judgements." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:163	1 Introduction There are important semantic distinctions between different types of English nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:163	For example, some nouns typically refer to a concrete physical object, such as book, tree, etc. Others are used to represent the process or the result of an event (e.g. birth, celebration)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:163	Such information is useful in disambiguating syntactically similar phrases and sentences, so as to provide more accurate semantic interpretations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:163	For instance, A MAN WITH HOBBIES and A MAN WITH APPLES share the same structure, but convey very different aspects about the man being referred to (i.e. activities vs possessions)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:163	Compiling such a lexicon by hand, e.g., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), requires tremendous time and expertise." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:163	In addition, when new words appear, these will have to be analyzed and added manually." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:163	Furthermore, a single, global lexicon may contain erroneous categorizations when used within a specific domain/genre; we would like a flexible lexicon, adaptable to a given corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:163	Also, in adapting semantic classifications of words to a particular genre or domain, we would like to be able to exploit continuing improvements in methods of extracting semantic occurrence patterns from text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:163	We present our initial efforts in discovering semantic classes incrementally under a weakly supervised bootstrapping process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:163	The approach is able to selectively learn from its own discoveries, thereby minimizing the effort needed to provide seed examples as well as maintaining a reasonable accuracy rate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:163	In what follows, we first focus on its application to an event-noun classification task, and then use a physical-object vs non-physical-object experiment as a showcase for the algorithms generality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:163	2 Bootstrapping Algorithm The bootstrapping algorithm discovers words with semantic properties similar to a small set of labelled seed examples." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:163	These examples can be manually selected from an existing lexicon." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:163	By simply changing the semantic property of the seed set, this algorithm can be applied to the task of discovering a variety of semantic classes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:163	Features Classification is performed using a perceptron-based model (Rosenblatt, 1958) that examines features of each word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:163	We use two kinds of features in our model: morphological (affix and word length), and contextual." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:163	Suffixes, such as -ion, often reveal the semantic type that a noun belongs to (e.g., destruction, explosion)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:163	Other suffixes like -er typically suggest non-event nouns (e.g. waiter, hanger)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:163	The set of affixes can be modified to reflect meaningful distinctions in the task at hand." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:163	Regarding word length, longer words tend to have more 37 syllables, and thus are more likely to contain affixes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:163	For example, if a word ends with -ment, its number of letters must be  5." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:163	We defined a partition of words based on word length: shortest (fewer than 5 letters), short (5-7), medium (8-12), long (13-19), and longest (> 19)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:163	Besides morphological features, we also make use of verbalized propositions resulting from the experiments of Van Durme et al.(2008) as contextual features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:163	These outputs are in the form of world knowledge factoids abstracted from texts, based on logical forms from parsed sentences, produced by the KNEXT system (see Schubert (2002) for details)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:163	The followings are some sample factoids about the word destruction, extracted from the British National Corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:163	 A PERSON-OR-ORGANIZATION MAY UNDERGO A DESTRUCTION  INDIVIDUAL -S MAY HAVE A DESTRUCTION  PROPERTY MAY UNDERGO A DESTRUCTION We take each verbalization (with the target word removed) as a contextual feature, such as PROPERTY MAY UNDERGO A . Words from the same semantic category (e.g., event nouns) should have semantic and syntactic similarities on the sentential level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:163	Thus their contextual features, which reflect the use of words both semantically and syntactically, should be similar." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:163	For instance, PROPERTY MAY UNDERGO A PROTECTION is another verbalization produced by KNEXT, suggesting the word protection may belong to the same category as destruction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:163	A few rough-and-ready heuristics are already employed by KNEXT to do the same task as we wish to automate here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:163	A built-in classifier judges nominals to be event or non-event ones based on analysis of endings, plus a list of event nouns whose endings are unrevealing, and a list of non-event nouns whose endings tend to suggest they are event nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:163	As a result, the factoids used as contextual features in our work already reflect the built-in classifiers attempt to distinguish event nouns from the rest." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:163	Thus, the use of these contextual features may bias the algorithm to perform seemingly well on event-noun classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:163	However, we will show that our algorithm works for classification of other semantic categories, for which KNEXT does not yet have discriminative procedures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:163	Iterative Training We use a bootstrapping procedure to iteratively train a perceptron-based linear classifier." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:163	A perceptron algorithm determines whether the active features of a test case are similar to those learned from given categories of examples." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:163	In an iterative training process, the classifier first learns from a small seed set, which contains examples of all categories (in binary classification, both positive and negative examples) manually selected to reflect human knowledge of semantic categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:163	The classifier then discovers new instances (and corresponding features) of each category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:163	Based on activation values, these newly discovered instances are selectively admitted into the original training set, which increases the size of training examples for the next iteration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:163	The iterative training algorithm described above is adopted from Klementiev and Roth (2006)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:163	The advantage of bootstrapping is the ability to automatically learn from new discoveries, which saves both time and effort required to manually examine a source lexicon." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:163	However, if implemented exactly as described above, this process has two apparent disadvantages: New examples may be wrongly classified by the model; and it is difficult to evaluate the discriminative models produced in successive iterations, as there are no standard data against which to judge them (the new examples are by definition previously unexamined)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:163	We propose two measures to alleviate these problems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:163	First, we admit into the training set only those instances whose activation values are higher than the mean activation of their corresponding categories in an iteration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:163	This sets a variable threshold that is correlated with the performance of the model at each iteration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:163	Second, we evaluate iterative results posthoc, using a Bootstrapping Score." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:163	This measures the efficacy of bootstrapping (i.e. the ratio of correct newly discovered instances to training examples) and precision (i.e. the proportion of correct discoveries among all those returned by the algorithm)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:163	We compute this score to decide which iteration has yielded the optimal discriminative model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:163	3 Building an Event-noun Lexicon We applied the bootstrapping algorithm to the task of discovering event nouns from a source lexicon." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:163	38 Event nouns are words that typically describe the occurrence, the process, or the result of an event." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:163	We first explore the effectiveness of this algorithm, and then describe a method of extracting the optimal model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:163	Top-ranked features in the optimal model are used to find subcategories of event nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:163	Experimental Setup The WordNet noun-list is chosen as the source lexicon (Fellbaum, 1998), which consists of 21,512 nouns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:163	The purpose of this task is to explore the separability of event nouns from this collection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:163	typical suffixes: appeasement, arrival, renewal, construction, robbery, departure, happening irregular cases: birth, collapse, crash, death, decline, demise, loss, murder Table 1: Examples of event-nouns in initial training set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:163	We manually selected 15 event nouns and 215 non-event nouns for the seed set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:163	Event-noun examples are representative of subcategories within the semantic class, as well as their commonly seen morphological structures (Table 1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:163	Non-event examples are primarily exceptions to morphological regularities (to prevent the algorithm from overly relying on affix features), such as, anything, ambition, diagonal." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:163	The subset of all contextual and morphological features represented by both event and non-event examples are used to bootstrap the training process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:163	Event Noun Discovery Reducing the number of working features is often an effective strategy in training a perceptron." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:163	We experimented with two cut-off thresholds for features: in Trial 1, features must appear at least 10 times (55,354 remaining); in Trial 2, features must appear at least 15 times (35,457 remaining)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:163	We set the training process to run for 20 iterations in both trials." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:163	Classification results of each iteration were collected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:163	We expect the algorithm to discover few event nouns during early iterations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:163	But with new instances found in each subsequent iteration, it ought to utilize newly seen features and discover more." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:163	Figure 1 confirms our intuition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:163	The number of classified event-noun instances increased sharply at the 15th iteration in Trial 1 and the 11th iteration in Trial 2, which may suggest overfitting of the training examples used in those iterations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:163	If so, this should also correlate with an increase of error rate in the classification results (error rate defined as the percentage of non-event nouns identified as event nouns in all discovered event nouns)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:163	We manually marked all misclassified event noun instances for the first 10 iterations in both trials." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:163	The error rate in Trial 2 is expected to significantly increase at the 10th iteration, while Trial 1 should exhibit little increase in error rate within this interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:163	This expectation is confirmed in Figure 2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:163	Extracting the Optimal Model We further pursued the task of finding the iteration that has yielded the best model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:163	Optimality is judged from two aspects: 1) the number of correctly identified event nouns should be significantly larger than the size of seed examples; and 2) the accuracy of classification results should be relatively high so that it takes little effort to clean up the result." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:163	Once the optimal model is determined, we analyze its most heavily weighted features and try to derive finer categories from them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:163	Furthermore, the optimal model could be used to discover new instances from other source lexicons in the future." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:163	We define a measure called the Bootstrapping Score (BS), serving a similar purpose as an F-score." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="83:163	(1) Here the Bootstrapping Rate (BR) is computed as: BR = |NEW||NEW|+|SEED|, (2) where |NEW| is the number of correctly identified new instances (seed examples excluded), and |SEED| is the size of seed examples." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:163	The rate of bootstrapping reveals how large the effect of the bootstrapping process is.

	<td class="line oc" title="7:94	This has been now an active research area for a couple of decades (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998; Weeds and Weir, 2003)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:94	This paper is motivated by one of the prominent applications of distributional similarity, namely identifying lexical expansions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:94	Lexical expansion looks for terms whose meaning implies that of a given target term, such as a query." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:94	It is widely employed to overcome lexical variability in applications like Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) and Question Answering (QA).Often, distributionalsimilaritymeasuresare used to identify expanding terms (e.g.(Xu and Croft, 1996; Mandala et al., 1999))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:94	Here we denote the relation between an expanding term u and an expanded term v as u  v." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:94	While distributional similarity is most prominently modeled by symmetric measures, lexical expansion is in general a directional relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:94	In IR, for instance, a user looking for baby food will be satisfied with documents about baby pap or baby juice (pap  food, juice  food); but when looking for frozen juice she will not be satisfied by frozen food." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:94	More generally, directional relations are abundant in NLP settings, making symmetric similarity measures less suitable for their identification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:94	Despite the need for directional similarity measures, their investigation counts, to the best of our knowledge, only few works (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Bhagat et al., 2007; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Michelbacher et al., 2007) and is utterly lacking." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:94	From an expansion perspective, the common expectation is that the context features characterizing an expanding word should be largely included in those of the expanded word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:94	This paper investigates the nature of directional similarity measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:94	We identify their desired properties, design a novel measure based on these properties, and demonstrate its empirical advantage in expansion settings over state-of-the-art measures1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:94	In broader prospect, we suggest that asymmetric measures might be more suitable than symmetric ones for many other settings as well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:94	2 Background The distributional word similarity scheme follows two steps." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:94	First, a feature vector is constructed for each word by collecting context words as features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:94	Each feature is assigned a weight indicating its relevance (or association) to the given word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:94	Then, word vectors are compared by some vector similarity measure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:94	1Our directional term-similarity resource will be available at http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:94	title=Textual_Entailment_Resource_Pool 69 To date, most distributional similarity research concentrated on symmetric measures, such as the widely cited and competitive (as shown in (Weeds and Weir, 2003)) LIN measure (Lin, 1998): LIN(u,v) = summationtext fFVuFVv[wu(f) + wv(f)]summationtext fFVu wu(f) + summationtext fFVv wv(f) where FVx is the feature vector of a word x and wx(f) is the weight of the feature f in that words vector, set to their pointwise mutual information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:94	Few works investigated a directional similarity approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:94	Weeds and Weir (2003) and Weeds et al.(2004) proposed a precision measure, denoted here WeedsPrec, for identifying the hyponymy relation and other generalization/specification cases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:94	It quantifies the weighted coverage (or inclusion) of the candidate hyponyms features (u) by the hypernyms (v) features: WeedsPrec(u  v) = summationtext fFVuFVv wu(f)summationtext fFVu wu(f) The assumption behind WeedsPrec is that if one word is indeed a generalization of the other then the features of the more specific word are likely to be included in those of the more general one (but not necessarily vice versa)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:94	Extending this rationale to the textual entailment setting, Geffet and Dagan (2005) expected that if the meaning of a word u entails that of v then all its prominent context features (under a certain notion of prominence) would be included in the feature vector of v as well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:94	Their experiments indeed revealed a strong empirical correlation between such complete inclusion of prominent features and lexical entailment, based on web data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:94	Yet, such complete inclusion cannot be feasibly assessed using an off-line corpus, due to the huge amount of required data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:94	Recently, (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) tried identifying the entailment relation between lexical-syntactic templates using WeedsPrec, but observed that it tends to promote unreliable relations involving infrequent templates." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:94	To remedy this, they proposed to balance the directional WeedsPrec measure by multiplying it with the symmetric LIN measure, denoted here balPrec: balPrec(uv)= radicalbig LIN(u,v)WeedsPrec(uv) Effectively, thismeasurepenalizesinfrequenttemplates having short feature vectors, as those usuallyyieldlowsymmetricsimilaritywiththelonger vectors of more common templates." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:94	3 A Statistical Inclusion Measure Our research goal was to develop a directional similarity measure suitable for learning asymmetric relations, focusing empirically on lexical expansion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:94	Thus, we aimed to quantify most effectively the above notion of feature inclusion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:94	For a candidate pair u  v, we will refer to the set of us features, which are those tested for inclusion, as tested features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:94	Amongst these features, those found in vs feature vector are termed included features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:94	In preliminary data analysis of pairs of feature vectors, which correspond to a known set of valid and invalid expansions, we identified the following desired properties for a distributional inclusion measure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:94	Such measure should reflect: 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:94	the proportion of included features amongst the tested ones (the core inclusion idea)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:94	2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:94	the relevance of included features to the expanding word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:94	3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:94	the relevance of included features to the expanded word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:94	4." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:94	that inclusion detection is less reliable if the number of features of either expanding or expanded word is small." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:94	3.1 Average Precision as the Basis for an Inclusion Measure As our starting point we adapted the Average Precision (AP) metric, commonly used to score ranked lists such as query search results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:94	This measure combines precision, relevance ranking and overall recall (Voorhees and Harman, 1999): AP = summationtextN r=1[P(r)  rel(r)] total number of relevant documents where r is the rank of a retrieved document amongst the N retrieved, rel(r) is an indicator function for the relevance of that document, and P(r) is precision at the given cut-off rank r. In our case the feature vector of the expanded word is analogous to the set of all relevant documentswhiletestedfeaturescorrespondtoretrieved documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:94	Included features thus correspond to relevant retrieved documents, yielding the follow70 ing analogous measure in our terminology: AP(u  v) = summationtext|FVu| r=1 [P(r)  rel(fr)] |FVv| rel(f) = braceleftbigg 1, if f  FV v 0, if f / FVv P(r) = |included features in ranks 1 to r|r where fr is the feature at rank r in FVu." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:94	This analogy yields a feature inclusion measure that partly addresses the above desired properties." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:94	Its score increases with a larger number of included features (correlating with the 1st property), while giving higher weight to highly ranked features of the expanding word (2nd property)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:94	To better meet the desired properties we introduce two modifications to the above measure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:94	First, we use the number of tested features |FVu| for normalization instead of |FVv|." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:94	This captures betterthenotionoffeatureinclusion(1st property), which targets the proportion of included features relative to the tested ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:94	Second, in the classical AP formula all relevant documents are considered relevant to the same extent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:94	However, features of the expanded word differ in their relevance within its vector (3rd property)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:94	We thus reformulate rel(f) to give higher relevance to highly ranked features in |FVv|: relprime(f) = braceleftbigg 1  rank(f,FVv) |FVv|+1 ,if f  FVv 0 ,if f / FVv where rank(f,FVv) is the rank of f in FVv." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:94	Incorporatingthesetwomodificationsyieldsthe APinc measure: APinc(uv)= summationtext|FVu| r=1 [P(r)  relprime(fr)] |FVu| Finally, we adopt the balancing approach in (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008), which, as explained in Section 2, penalizes similarity for infrequent words having fewer features (4th property) (in our version, we truncated LIN similarity lists after top 1000 words)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:94	This yields our proposed directional measure balAPinc: balAPinc(uv) = radicalbig LIN(u,v)  APinc(uv) 4 Evaluation and Results 4.1 Evaluation Setting We tested our similarity measure by evaluating its utility for lexical expansion, compared with baselines of the LIN, WeedsPrec and balPrec measures (Section 2) and a balanced version of AP (Section 3), denoted balAP." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:94	Feature vectors were created by parsing the Reuters RCV1 corpus and taking the words related to each term through a dependency relation as its features (coupled with the relationnameanddirection, asin(Lin, 1998))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:94	We considered for expansion only terms that occur at least 10 times in the corpus, and as features only terms that occur at least twice." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:94	As a typical lexical expansion task we used the ACE 2005 events dataset2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:94	This standard IE dataset specifies 33 event types, such as Attack, Divorce, and Law Suit, with all event mentions annotated in the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:94	For our lexical expansion evaluation we considered the first IE subtask of finding sentences that mention the event." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:94	For each event we specified a set of representative words (seeds), by selecting typical terms for the event (4 on average) from its ACE definition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:94	Next, for each similarity measure, the terms found similar to any of the events seeds (u  seed) were taken as expansion terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:94	Finally, to measure the sole contribution of expansion, we removed from the corpus all sentences that contain a seed word and then extracted all sentences that contain expansion terms as mentioning the event." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:94	Each of these sentences was scored by the sum of similarity scores of its expansion terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:94	To evaluate expansion quality we compared the ranked list of sentences for each event to the goldstandard annotation of event mentions, using the standard Average Precision (AP) evaluation measure." ></td>
