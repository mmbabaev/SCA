Thumbs Up? Sentiment Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques

	<td class="line x" title="2:181	Sentiment Classiflcation using Machine Learning Techniques Bo Pang and Lillian Lee Department of Computer Science Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853 USA fpabo,lleeg@cs.cornell.edu Shivakumar Vaithyanathan IBM Almaden Research Center 650 Harry Rd. San Jose, CA 95120 USA shiv@almaden.ibm.com Abstract We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:181	Using movie reviews as data, we flnd that standard machine learning techniques deflnitively outperform human-produced baselines." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:181	However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classiflcation, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classiflcation as on traditional topic-based categorization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:181	We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classiflcation problem more challenging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:181	1 Introduction Today, very large amounts of information are available in on-line documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:181	As part of the efiort to better organize this information for users, researchers have been actively investigating the problem of automatic text categorization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:181	The bulk of such work has focused on topical categorization, attempting to sort documents according to their subject matter (e.g. , sports vs. politics)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:181	However, recent years have seen rapid growth in on-line discussion groups and review sites (e.g. , the New York Times Books web page) where a crucial characteristic of the posted articles is their sentiment, or overall opinion towards the subject matter | for example, whether a product review is positive or negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:181	Labeling these articles with their sentiment would provide succinct summaries to readers; indeed, these labels are part of the appeal and value-add of such sites as www.rottentomatoes.com, which both labels movie reviews that do not contain explicit rating indicators and normalizes the difierent rating schemes that individual reviewers use." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:181	Sentiment classiflcation would also be helpful in business intelligence applications (e.g. MindfulEyes Lexant system1) and recommender systems (e.g. , Terveen et al.(1997), Tatemura (2000)), where user input and feedback could be quickly summarized; indeed, in general, free-form survey responses given in natural language format could be processed using sentiment categorization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:181	Moreover, there are also potential applications to message flltering; for example, one might be able to use sentiment information to recognize and discard \ ames'(Spertus, 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:181	In this paper, we examine the efiectiveness of applying machine learning techniques to the sentiment classiflcation problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:181	A challenging aspect of this problem that seems to distinguish it from traditional topic-based classiflcation is that while topics are often identiflable by keywords alone, sentiment can be expressed in a more subtle manner." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:181	For example, the sentence \How could anyone sit through this movie?' contains no single word that is obviously negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:181	(See Section 7 for more examples)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:181	Thus, sentiment seems to require more understanding than the usual topic-based classiflcation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:181	So, apart from presenting our results obtained via machine learning techniques, we also analyze the problem to gain a better understanding of how dicult it is. 2 Previous Work This section brie y surveys previous work on nontopic-based text categorization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:181	One area of research concentrates on classifying documents according to their source or source style, with statistically-detected stylistic variation (Biber, 1988) serving as an important cue." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:181	Examples include author, publisher (e.g. , the New York Times vs. The Daily News), native-language background, and \brow' (e.g. , high-brow vs. \popular', or low-brow) (Mosteller and Wallace, 1984; Argamon-Engelson et 1http://www.mindfuleye.com/about/lexant.htm Association for Computational Linguistics." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="24:181	Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural al. , 1998; Tomokiyo and Jones, 2001; Kessler et al. , 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:181	Another, more related area of research is that of determining the genre of texts; subjective genres, such as \editorial', are often one of the possible categories (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al. , 1997; Finn et al. , 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:181	Other work explicitly attempts to flnd features indicating that subjective language is being used (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al. , 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:181	But, while techniques for genre categorization and subjectivity detection can help us recognize documents that express an opinion, they do not address our speciflc classiflcation task of determining what that opinion actually is. Most previous research on sentiment-based classiflcation has been at least partially knowledge-based." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="28:181	Some of this work focuses on classifying the semantic orientation of individual words or phrases, using linguistic heuristics or a pre-selected set of seed words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:181	Past work on sentiment-based categorization of entire documents has often involved either the use of models inspired by cognitive linguistics (Hearst, 1992; Sack, 1994) or the manual or semi-manual construction of discriminant-word lexicons (Huettner and Subasic, 2000; Das and Chen, 2001; Tong, 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:181	Interestingly, our baseline experiments, described in Section 4, show that humans may not always have the best intuition for choosing discriminating words." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="31:181	Turneys (2002) work on classiflcation of reviews is perhaps the closest to ours.2 He applied a speciflc unsupervised learning technique based on the mutual information between document phrases and the words \excellent' and \poor', where the mutual information is computed using statistics gathered by a search engine." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:181	In contrast, we utilize several completely prior-knowledge-free supervised machine learning methods, with the goal of understanding the inherent diculty of the task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:181	3 The Movie-Review Domain For our experiments, we chose to work with movie reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:181	This domain is experimentally convenient because there are large on-line collections of such reviews, and because reviewers often summarize their overall sentiment with a machine-extractable rating indicator, such as a number of stars; hence, we did not need to hand-label the data for supervised learning or evaluation purposes." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="35:181	We also note that Turney (2002) found movie reviews to be the most 2Indeed, although our choice of title was completely independent of his, our selections were eerily similar." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="37:181	But we stress that the machine learning methods and features we use are not speciflc to movie reviews, and should be easily applicable to other domains as long as sucient training data exists." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:181	Our data source was the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) archive of the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup.3 We selected only reviews where the author rating was expressed either with stars or some numerical value (other conventions varied too widely to allow for automatic processing)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:181	Ratings were automatically extracted and converted into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:181	For the work described in this paper, we concentrated only on discriminating between positive and negative sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:181	To avoid domination of the corpus by a small number of proliflc reviewers, we imposed a limit of fewer than 20 reviews per author per sentiment category, yielding a corpus of 752 negative and 1301 positive reviews, with a total of 144 reviewers represented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:181	This dataset will be available on-line at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ (the URL contains hyphens only around the word \review')." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:181	4 A Closer Look At the Problem Intuitions seem to difier as to the diculty of the sentiment detection problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:181	An expert on using machine learning for text categorization predicted relatively low performance for automatic methods." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:181	On the other hand, it seems that distinguishing positive from negative reviews is relatively easy for humans, especially in comparison to the standard text categorization problem, where topics can be closely related." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:181	One might also suspect that there are certain words people tend to use to express strong sentiments, so that it might suce to simply produce a list of such words by introspection and rely on them alone to classify the texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:181	To test this latter hypothesis, we asked two graduate students in computer science to (independently) choose good indicator words for positive and negative sentiments in movie reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:181	Their selections, shown in Figure 1, seem intuitively plausible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:181	We then converted their responses into simple decision procedures that essentially count the number of the proposed positive and negative words in a given document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:181	We applied these procedures to uniformlydistributed data, so that the random-choice baseline result would be 50%." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="55:181	While the tie rates suggest that the brevity of the human-produced lists is a factor in the relatively poor performance results, it is not the case that size alone necessarily limits accuracy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:181	Based on a very preliminary examination of frequency counts in the entire corpus (including test data) plus introspection, we created a list of seven positive and seven negative words (including punctuation), shown in Figure 2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:181	As that flgure indicates, using these words raised the accuracy to 69%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:181	Also, although this third list is of comparable length to the other two, it has a much lower tie rate of 16%." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:181	or \still', would probably not have been proposed as possible candidates merely through introspection, although upon re ection one sees their merit (the question mark tends to occur in sentences like \What was the director thinking?'; \still' appears in sentences like \Still, though, it was worth seeing')." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:181	We conclude from these preliminary experiments that it is worthwhile to explore corpus-based techniques, rather than relying on prior intuitions, to select good indicator features and to perform sentiment classiflcation in general." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:181	These experiments also provide us with baselines for experimental comparison; in particular, the third baseline of 69% might actually be considered somewhat dicult to beat, since it was achieved by examination of the test data (although our examination was rather cursory; we do 4Later experiments using these words as features for machine learning methods did not yield better results." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="65:181	5 Machine Learning Methods Our aim in this work was to examine whether it sufflces to treat sentiment classiflcation simply as a special case of topic-based categorization (with the two \topics' being positive sentiment and negative sentiment), or whether special sentiment-categorization methods need to be developed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:181	We experimented with three standard algorithms: Naive Bayes classiflcation, maximum entropy classiflcation, and support vector machines." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:181	The philosophies behind these three algorithms are quite difierent, but each has been shown to be efiective in previous text categorization studies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:181	To implement these machine learning algorithms on our document data, we used the following standard bag-of-features framework." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="71:181	5.1 Naive Bayes One approach to text classiflcation is to assign to a given document d the class c = argmaxc P(c j d)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:181	We derive the Naive Bayes (NB) classifler by flrst observing that by Bayes rule, P(c j d) = P(c)P(d j c)P(d) ; where P(d) plays no role in selecting c." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:181	To estimate the term P(d j c), Naive Bayes decomposes it by assuming the fis are conditionally independent given ds class: PNB(c j d) := P(c) Qm i=1 P(fi j c) ni(d) P(d) : Our training method consists of relative-frequency estimation of P(c) and P(fi j c), using add-one smoothing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:181	Despite its simplicity and the fact that its conditional independence assumption clearly does not hold in real-world situations, Naive Bayes-based text categorization still tends to perform surprisingly well (Lewis, 1998); indeed, Domingos and Pazzani (1997) show that Naive Bayes is optimal for certain problem classes with highly dependent features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:181	On the other hand, more sophisticated algorithms might (and often do) yield better results; we examine two such algorithms next." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:181	5.2 Maximum Entropy Maximum entropy classiflcation (MaxEnt, or ME, for short) is an alternative technique which has proven efiective in a number of natural language processing applications (Berger et al. , 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:181	Nigam et al.(1999) show that it sometimes, but not always, outperforms Naive Bayes at standard text classiflcation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:181	Its estimate of P(c j d) takes the following exponential form: PME(c j d) := 1Z(d) exp X i i;cFi;c(d;c) ! ; where Z(d) is a normalization function." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:181	Fi;c is a feature/class function for feature fi and class c, deflned as follows:6 Fi;c(d;c0) := n1; n i(d) > 0 and c0 = c 0 otherwise : For instance, a particular feature/class function might flre if and only if the bigram \still hate' appears and the documents sentiment is hypothesized to be negative.7 Importantly, unlike Naive Bayes, MaxEnt makes no assumptions about the relationships between features, and so might potentially perform better when conditional independence assumptions are not met." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:181	The i;cs are feature-weight parameters; inspection of the deflnition of PME shows that a large i;c means that fi is considered a strong indicator for 6We use a restricted deflnition of feature/class functions so that MaxEnt relies on the same sort of feature information as Naive Bayes." ></td>

The parameter values are set so as to maximize the entropy of the induced distribution (hence the classiflers name) subject to the constraint that the expected values of the feature/class functions with respect to the model are equal to their expected values with respect to the training data: the underlying philosophy is that we should choose the model making the fewest assumptions about the data while still remaining consistent with it, which makes intuitive sense." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:181	We use ten iterations of the improved iterative scaling algorithm (Della Pietra et al. , 1997) for parameter training (this was a sucient number of iterations for convergence of training-data accuracy), together with a Gaussian prior to prevent overfltting (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:181	5.3 Support Vector Machines Support vector machines (SVMs) have been shown to be highly efiective at traditional text categorization, generally outperforming Naive Bayes (Joachims, 1998)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="89:181	In the two-category case, the basic idea behind the training procedure is to flnd a hyperplane, represented by vector ~w, that not only separates the document vectors in one class from those in the other, but for which the separation, or margin, is as large as possible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:181	This search corresponds to a constrained optimization problem; letting cj 2 f1;1g (corresponding to positive and negative) be the correct class of document dj, the solution can be written as ~w := X j fijcj ~dj; fij  0; where the fijs are obtained by solving a dual optimization problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:181	Those ~dj such that fij is greater than zero are called support vectors, since they are the only document vectors contributing to ~w. Classiflcation of test instances consists simply of determining which side of ~ws hyperplane they fall on." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:184	1 Introduction Text categorization concerns the problem of automatically assigning given text passages (paragraphs or documents) into predefined categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:184	Due to the rapid explosion of texts in digital form, text categorization has become an important area of research owing to the need to automatically organize and index large text collections in various ways." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="7:184	Such techniques are currently being applied in many areas, including language identification, authorship attribution (Stamatatos et al. , 2000), text genre classification (Kesseler et al. , 1997; Stamatatos et al. , 2000), topic identification (Dumais et al. , 1998; Lewis, 1992; McCallum, 1998; Yang, 1999), and subjective sentiment classification (Turney, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:184	Many standard machine learning techniques have been applied to automated text categorization problems, such as naive-Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, linear least squares models, neural networks, and K-nearest neighbor classifiers (Yang, 1999; Sebastiani, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:184	A common aspect of these approaches is that they treat text categorization as a standard classification problem, and thereby reduce the learning process to two simple steps: feature engineering, and classification learning over the feature space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:184	Of these two steps, feature engineering is critical to achieving good performance in text categorization problems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:184	Once good features are identified, almost any reasonable technique for learning a classifier seems to perform well (Scott, 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:184	Unfortunately, the standard classification learning methodology has several drawbacks for text categorization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:184	First, feature construction is usually language dependent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:184	Various techniques such as stop-word removal or stemming require language specific knowledge to design adequately." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:184	Moreover, whether one can use a purely word-level approach is itself a language dependent issue." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:184	In many Asian languages such as Chinese or Japanese, identifying words from character sequences is hard, and any word-based approach must suffer added complexity in coping with segmentation errors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:184	Second, feature selection is task dependent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:184	For example, tasks like authorship attribution or genre classification require attention to linguistic style markers (Stamatatos et al. , 2000), whereas topic detection systems rely more heavily on bag of words features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:184	Third, there are an enormous number of possible features to consider in text categorization problems, and standard feature selection approaches do not always cope well in such circumstances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:184	For example, given an enormous number of features, the cumulative effect of uncommon features can still have an important effect on classification accuracy, even though infrequent features contribute less information than common features individually." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="24:184	Finally, by treating text categorization as a classical classification problem, standard approaches can ignore the fact that texts are written in natural language, meaning that they have many implicit regularities that can be well modeled with specific tools from natural language processing." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="29:184	The success of this simple method, we think, is due to the effectiveness of well known statistical language modeling techniques, which surprisingly have had little significant impact on the learning algorithms normally applied to text categorization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:184	Nevertheless, statistical language modeling is also concerned with modeling the semantic, syntactic, lexicographical and phonological regularities of natural languageand would seem to provide a natural foundation for text categorization problems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:184	One interesting difference, however, is that instead of explicitly pre-computing features and selecting a subset based on arbitrary decisions, the language modeling approach simply considers all character (or word) subsequences occurring in the text as candidate features, and implicitly considers the contribution of every feature in the final model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:184	Thus, the language modeling approach completely avoids a potentially error-prone feature selection process." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:226	The subject would be extracted as the hiree." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:226	Meta-Bootstrapping and Basilisk were designed to learn words that belong to a semantic category (e.g. , truck is a VEHICLE and seashore is a LOCATION)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="67:226	The principle behind this approach is that words of the same semantic class appear in similar pattern contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:226	For example, the phrases lived in and traveled to will co-occur with many noun phrases that represent LOCATIONS." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="73:226	First, MetaBoot automatically creates a set of extraction patterns for the corpus by applying and instantiating syntactic templates." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:210	In contrast, the goal of our work is to classify individual sentences as subjective or objective." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:210	Document-level classification can distinguish between subjective texts, such as editorials and reviews, and objective texts, such as newspaper articles." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:210	But in reality, most documents contain a mix of both subjective and objective sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:210	Subjective texts often include some factual information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:210	For example, editorial articles frequently contain factual information to back up the arguments being made, and movie reviews often mention the actors and plot of a movie as well as the theatres where its currently playing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:210	Even if one is willing to discard subjective texts in their entirety, the objective texts usually contain a great deal of subjective information in addition to facts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:210	For example, newspaper articles are generally considered to be relatively objective documents, but in a recent study (Wiebe et al. , 2001) 44% of sentences in a news collection were found to be subjective (after editorial and review articles were removed)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:210	One of the main obstacles to producing a sentencelevel subjectivity classifier is a lack of training data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:210	To train a document-level classifier, one can easily find collections of subjective texts, such as editorials and reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:210	For example, (Pang et al. , 2002) collected reviews from a movie database and rated them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the rating (e.g. , number of stars) given by the reviewer." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="57:210	One of our hypotheses was that extraction patterns would be able to represent subjective expressions that have noncompositional meanings." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="61:210	It is a relatively flexible construction that may be more generally represented as <x> drives <y> up the wall, where x and y may be arbitrary noun phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:210	This pattern would match many different sentences, such as George drives me up the wall, She drives the mayor up the wall, or The nosy old man drives his quiet neighbors up the wall. We also wondered whether the extraction pattern representation might reveal slight variations of the same verb or noun phrase that have different connotations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:210	For example, you can say that a comedian bombed last night, which is a subjective statement, but you cant express this sentiment with the passive voice of bombed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:210	In Section 3.2, we will show examples of extraction patterns representing subjective expressions which do in fact exhibit both of these phenomena." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:210	A variety of algorithms have been developed to automatically learn extraction patterns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:210	Most of these algorithms require special training resources, such as texts annotated with domain-specific tags (e.g. , AutoSlog (Riloff, 1993), CRYSTAL (Soderland et al. , 1995), RAPIER (Califf, 1998), SRV (Freitag, 1998), WHISK (Soderland, 1999)) or manually defined keywords, frames, or object recognizers (e.g. , PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993) and LIEP (Huffman, 1996))." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:218	For (1c), the predicate problematic has the argument recharger instead of the head word of the noun phrase the quality of the recharger, because just using quality is not informative to describe the sentiment of the attribute of a real-world object." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:218	Moreover, disambiguation of sentiments is necessary: in (1b) the adjective high has the unfavorable feature, but high can be treated as favorable in the expression resolution is high." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:218	We regard this task as translation from text to sentiment units, because we noticed that the deep language analysis techniques which are required for the extraction of sentiment units are analogous to those which have been studied for the purpose of language translation." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="76:179	An anchor may be too general in the sense that many common words have multiple meanings, and not all of them reflect a chosen sentiment orientation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:179	For example, poor can refer to an objective economic state that does not necessarily express negative sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:179	As a result, a word such as income appears 4.18 times as frequently with poor as excellent, even though it does not convey negative sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:179	Similarly, excellent has a technical meaning in antiquity trading, which causes it to appear 3.34 times as frequently with furniture." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:179	An anchor may also be too specific, in the sense that there are a variety of different ways to express sentiment, and a single anchor may not capture them all." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:179	So a word like pretentious carries a strong negative sentiment but co-occurs only slightly more frequently (1.23 times) with excellent than poor." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:179	Likewise, fascination generally reflects a positive sentiment, yet it appears slightly more frequently (1.06 times) with poor than excellent." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="84:179	A feature set may contain many words and phrases, and each of them requires a separate AltaVista query for every chosen anchor word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:179	In the case of 30,000 features and ten queries per minute, downloads for a single anchor word require over two days of data collection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:179	An alternative approach is to access a large collection of documents directly." ></td>

A Sentimental Education: Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization Based On Minimum Cuts

	<td class="line x" title="2:149	To determine this sentiment polarity, we propose a novel machine-learning method that applies text-categorization techniques to just the subjective portions of the document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:149	Extracting these portions can be implemented using efficient techniques for finding minimum cuts in graphs; this greatly facilitates incorporation of cross-sentence contextual constraints." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:149	1 Introduction The computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity has recently attracted a great deal of attention (see references), in part because of its potential applications." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:149	For instance, informationextraction and question-answering systems could flag statements and queries regarding opinions rather than facts (Cardie et al. , 2003)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:149	Also, it has proven useful for companies, recommender systems, and editorial sites to create summaries of peoples experiences and opinions that consist of subjective expressions extracted from reviews (as is commonly done in movie ads) or even just a reviews polarity  positive (thumbs up) or negative (thumbs down)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:149	Document polarity classification poses a significant challenge to data-driven methods, resisting traditional text-categorization techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:149	Previous approaches focused on selecting indicative lexical features (e.g. , the word good), classifying a document according to the number of such features that occur anywhere within it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:149	In contrast, we propose the following process: (1) label the sentences in the document as either subjective or objective, discarding the latter; and then (2) apply a standard machine-learning classifier to the resulting extract." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:149	This can prevent the polarity classifier from considering irrelevant or even potentially misleading text: for example, although the sentence The protagonist tries to protect her good name contains the word good, it tells us nothing about the authors opinion and in fact could well be embedded in a negative movie review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:149	Also, as mentioned above, subjectivity extracts can be provided to users as a summary of the sentiment-oriented content of the document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:149	Our results show that the subjectivity extracts we create accurately represent the sentiment information of the originating documents in a much more compact form: depending on choice of downstream polarity classifier, we can achieve highly statistically significant improvement (from 82.8% to 86.4%) or maintain the same level of performance for the polarity classification task while retaining only 60% of the reviews words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:149	Also, we explore extraction methods based on a minimum cut formulation, which provides an efficient, intuitive, and effective means for integrating inter-sentencelevel contextual information with traditional bag-ofwords features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:149	2 Method 2.1 Architecture One can consider document-level polarity classification to be just a special (more difficult) case of text categorization with sentimentrather than topic-based categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:149	Hence, standard machinelearning classification techniques, such as support vector machines (SVMs), can be applied to the entire documents themselves, as was done by Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan (2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:149	We refer to such classification techniques as default polarity classifiers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:149	However, as noted above, we may be able to improve polarity classification by removing objective sentences (such as plot summaries in a movie review)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:149	We therefore propose, as depicted in Figure 1, to first employ a subjectivity detector that determines whether each sentence is subjective or not: discarding the objective ones creates an extract that should better represent a reviews subjective content to a default polarity classifier." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="20:149	To our knowledge, previous work has not integrated sentence-level subjectivity detection with document-level sentiment polarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:149	Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) provide methods for sentencelevel analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not, but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:149	The motivation behind the singlesentence selection method of Beineke et al.(2004) is to reveal a documents sentiment polarity, but they do not evaluate the polarity-classification accuracy that results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:149	2.2 Context and Subjectivity Detection As with document-level polarity classification, we could perform subjectivity detection on individual sentences by applying a standard classification algorithm on each sentence in isolation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:149	However, modeling proximity relationships between sentences would enable us to leverage coherence: text spans occurring near each other (within discourse boundaries) may share the same subjectivity status, other things being equal (Wiebe, 1994)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:149	We would therefore like to supply our algorithms with pair-wise interaction information, e.g., to specify that two particular sentences should ideally receive the same subjectivity label but not state which label this should be." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:149	Incorporating such information is somewhat unnatural for classifiers whose input consists simply of individual feature vectors, such as Naive Bayes or SVMs, precisely because such classifiers label each test item in isolation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:149	One could define synthetic features or feature vectors to attempt to overcome this obstacle." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:149	However, we propose an alternative that avoids the need for such feature engineering: we use an efficient and intuitive graph-based formulation relying on finding minimum cuts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:149	Our approach is inspired by Blum and Chawla (2001), although they focused on similarity between items (the motivation being to combine labeled and unlabeled data), whereas we are concerned with physical proximity between the items to be classified; indeed, in computer vision, modeling proximity information via graph cuts has led to very effective classification (Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih, 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:149	2.3 Cut-based classification Figure 2 shows a worked example of the concepts in this section." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:149	Suppose we have n items x1,,xn to divide into two classes C1 and C2, and we have access to two types of information:  Individual scores indj(xi): non-negative estimates of each xis preference for being in Cj based on just the features of xi alone; and  Association scores assoc(xi,xk): non-negative estimates of how important it is that xi and xk be in the same class.1 We would like to maximize each items net happiness: its individual score for the class it is assigned to, minus its individual score for the other class." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:149	But, we also want to penalize putting tightlyassociated items into different classes." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="47:149	Observe that every cut corresponds to a partition of the items and has cost equal to the partition cost." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:149	Practical advantages As we have noted, formulating our subjectivity-detection problem in terms of graphs allows us to model item-specific and pairwise information independently." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:149	Note that this is a very flexible paradigm." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:149	For instance, it is perfectly legitimate to use knowledge-rich algorithms employing deep linguistic knowledge about sentiment indicators to derive the individual scores." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="54:149	But a crucial advantage specific to the utilization of a minimum-cut-based approach is that we can use maximum-flow algorithms with polynomial asymptotic running times  and near-linear running times in practice  to exactly compute the minimumcost cut(s), despite the apparent intractability of the optimization problem (Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, 1990; Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin, 1993).2 In contrast, other graph-partitioning problems that have been previously used to formulate NLP classification problems3 are NP-complete (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Agrawal et al. , 2003; Joachims, 2003)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="9:232	Search engines are extremely helpful for several linguistic tasks, such as computing usage statistics or nding a subset of web documents to analyze in depth; however, these engines were not designed as building blocks for NLP applications." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:232	Further, the applications must often then fetch some web documents, which at scale can be very time-consuming." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:232	In response to heavy programmatic search engine use, Google has created the Google API to shunt programmatic queries away from Google.com and has placed hard quotas on the number of daily queries a program can issue to the API." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:232	Other search engines have also introduced mechanisms to limit programmatic queries, forcing applications to introduce courtesy waits between queries and to limit the number of queries they issue." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:232	To understand these ef ciency problems in more detail, consider the KNOWITALL information extraction system (Etzioni et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:232	KNOWITALL has a generateand-test architecture that extracts information in two stages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:232	First, KNOWITALL utilizes a small set of domainindependent extraction patterns to generate candidate facts (cf.(Hearst, 1992))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:232	For example, the generic pattern NP1 such as NPList2 indicates that the head of each simple noun phrase (NP) in NPList2 is a member of the class named in NP1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:232	By instantiating the pattern for class City, KNOWITALL extracts three candidate cities from the sentence: We provide tours to cities such as Paris, London, and Berlin." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:232	Note that it must also fetch each document that contains a potential candidate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:232	Next, extending the PMI-IR algorithm (Turney, 2001), KNOWITALL automatically tests the plausibility of the candidate facts it extracts using pointwise mutual information (PMI) statistics computed from search-engine hit counts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:232	For example, to assess the likelihood that Yakima is a city, KNOWITALL will compute the PMI between Yakima and a set of k discriminator phrases that tend to have high mutual information with city names (e.g. , the simple phrase city )." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="24:232	Due to KNOWITALLs dependence on search-engine queries, large-scale experiments utilizing KNOWITALL take days and even weeks to complete, which makes research using KNOWITALL slow and cumbersome." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="61:232	The observation that the second stage is slow, even if it is executed locally, is important because it shows that merely operating a private search engine does not solve the problem (see Section 2.1)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="232:241	However, the source filter exhibits by far the best results using the MRFA measure, a value of 11.267." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="233:241	The performance improvement is due to the filters ability to recognize the answers to the hardest questions, for which the other filters have the most trouble (questions mugabe 7 and 8)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="234:241	For these questions, the rank of the first answer improves from 153 to 21, and from 182 to 11, respectively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="235:241	With the exception of question venezuela 3, which does not contain a clear source (and is problematic altogether because there is only a single answer in the corpus and the questions qualification as opinion is not clear) the source filter always ranked an answer within the first 25 answers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="236:241	Thus, source filters can be especially useful in systems that rely on the presence of an answer within the first few ranked answer segments and then invoke more sophisticated analysis in the additional processing phase." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:161	1 Introduction Sophisticated language processing in recent years has made possible increasingly complex challenges for text analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:161	One such challenge is recognizing, classifying, and understanding opinionated text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:161	This ability is desirable for various tasks, including filtering advertisements, separating the arguments in online debate or discussions, and ranking web documents cited as authorities on contentious topics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:161	The challenge is made very difficult by a general inability to define opinion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:161	Our preliminary reading of a small selection of the available literature (Aristotle, 1954; Toulmin et al. , 1979; Perelman, 1970; Wallace, 1975), as well as our own text analysis, indicates that a profitable approach to opinion requires a system to know and/or identify at least the following elements: the topic (T), the opinion holder (H), the belief (B), and the opinion valence (V)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:161	For the purposes of the various interested communities, neutral-valence opinions (such as we believe the sun will rise tomorrow; Susan believes that John has three children) is of less interest; more relevant are opinions in which the valence is positive or negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:161	Such valence often falls together with the actual belief, as in going to Mars is a waste of money; in which the word waste signifies both the belief a lot [of money] and the valence bad/undesirable, but need not always do so: Smith[the holder] believes that abortion should be permissible[the topic] although he thinks that is a bad thing[the valence]." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:161	As the core first step of our research, we would like an automated system to identify, given an opinionated text, all instances of the [Holder/Topic/Valence] opinion triads it contains 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:161	Exploratory manual work has shown this to be a difficult task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:161	We therefore simplify the task as follows." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:161	We build a classifier that simply identifies in a text all the sentences expressing a valence." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="17:161	As primary indicators, we note from newspaper editorials and online exhortatory text that certain modal verbs (should, must) and adjectives and adverbs (better, best, unfair, ugly, nice, desirable, nicely, luckily) are strong markers of opinion." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:189	This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, three stars is intuitively closer to four stars than to one star." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:189	We rst evaluate human performance at the task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:189	Then, we apply a metaalgorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given a6 -ary classi ers output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:189	1 Introduction There has recently been a dramatic surge of interest in sentiment analysis, as more and more people become aware of the scienti c challenges posed and the scope of new applications enabled by the processing of subjective language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:189	(The papers collected by Qu, Shanahan, and Wiebe (2004) form a representative sample of research in the area)." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="9:189	Most prior work on the speci c problem of categorizing expressly opinionated text has focused on the binary distinction of positive vs. negative (Turney, 2002; Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002; Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock, 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:189	But it is often helpful to have more information than this binary distinction provides, especially if one is ranking items by recommendation or comparing several reviewers opinions: example applications include collaborative ltering and deciding which conference submissions to accept." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:189	Therefore, in this paper we consider generalizing to ner-grained scales: rather than just determine whether a review is thumbs up or not, we attempt to infer the authors implied numerical rating, such as three stars or four stars . Note that this differs from identifying opinion strength (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa, 2004): rants and raves have the same strength but represent opposite evaluations, and referee forms often allow one to indicate that one is very con dent (high strength) that a conference submission is mediocre (middling rating)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:189	Also, our task differs from ranking not only because one can be given a single item to classify (as opposed to a set of items to be ordered relative to one another), but because there are settings in which classi cation is harder than ranking, and vice versa." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:189	One can apply standarda6 -ary classi ers or regression to this rating-inference problem; independent work by Koppel and Schler (2005) considers such 115 methods." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:189	But an alternative approach that explicitly incorporates information about item similarities together with label similarity information (for instance, one star is closer to two stars than to four stars ) is to think of the task as one of metric labeling (Kleinberg and Tardos, 2002), where label relations are encoded via a distance metric." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:189	This observation yields a meta-algorithm, applicable to both semi-supervised (via graph-theoretic techniques) and supervised settings, that alters a given a6 -ary classi ers output so that similar items tend to be assigned similar labels." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:189	In what follows, we rst demonstrate that humans can discern relatively small differences in (hidden) evaluation scores, indicating that rating inference is indeed a meaningful task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:189	We then present three types of algorithms one-vs-all, regression, and metric labeling that can be distinguished by how explicitly they attempt to leverage similarity between items and between labels." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:189	Next, we consider what item similarity measure to apply, proposing one based on the positive-sentence percentage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:189	Incorporating this new measure within the metriclabeling framework is shown to often provide signi cant improvements over the other algorithms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:189	We hope that some of the insights derived here might apply to other scales for text classifcation that have been considered, such as clause-level opinion strength (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa, 2004); affect types like disgust (Subasic and Huettner, 2001; Liu, Lieberman, and Selker, 2003); reading level (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004); and urgency or criticality (Horvitz, Jacobs, and Hovel, 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:189	2 Problem validation and formulation We rst ran a small pilot study on human subjects in order to establish a rough idea of what a reasonable classi cation granularity is: if even people cannot accurately infer labels with respect to a ve-star scheme with half stars, say, then we cannot expect a learning algorithm to do so." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:189	Indeed, some potential obstacles to accurate rating inference include lack of calibration (e.g. , what an understated author intends as high praise may seem lukewarm), author inconsistency at assigning ne-grained ratings, and Rating diff." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="26:189	For data, we rst collected Internet movie reviews in English from four authors, removing explicit rating indicators from each documents text automatically." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:189	Now, while the obvious experiment would be to ask subjects to guess the rating that a review represents, doing so would force us to specify a xed rating-scale granularity in advance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:189	Instead, we examined peoples ability to discern relative differences, because by varying the rating differences represented by the test instances, we can evaluate multiple granularities in a single experiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:189	Speci cally, at intervals over a number of weeks, we authors (a non-native and a native speaker of English) examined pairs of reviews, attemping to determine whether the rst review in each pair was (1) more positive than, (2) less positive than, or (3) as positive as the second." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:189	The texts in any particular review pair were taken from the same author to factor out the effects of cross-author divergence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:189	As Table 1 shows, both subjects performed perfectly when the rating separation was at least 3 notches in the original scale (we de ne a notch as a half star in a fouror ve-star scheme and 10 points in a 100-point scheme)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:189	Interestingly, although human performance drops as rating difference decreases, even at a one-notch separation, both subjects handily outperformed the random-choice baseline of 33%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:189	However, there was large variation in accuracy between subjects.2 1For example, the critic Dennis Schwartz writes that sometimes the review itself [indicates] the letter grade should have been higher or lower, as the review might fail to take into consideration my overall impression of the lm which I hope to capture in the grade (http://www.sover.net/ ozus/cinema.htm)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:189	2One contributing factor may be that the subjects viewed disjoint document sets, since we wanted to maximize experimental coverage of the types of document pairs within each difference class." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:189	We thus cannot report inter-annotator agreement, 116 Because of this variation, we de ned two different classi cation regimes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:189	From the evidence above, a three-class task (categories 0, 1, and 2 essentially negative, middling, and positive, respectively) seems like one that most people would do quite well at (but we should not assume 100% human accuracy: according to our one-notch results, people may misclassify borderline cases like 2.5 stars)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:189	Our study also suggests that people could do at least fairly well at distinguishing full stars in a zeroto four-star scheme." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:189	However, when we began to construct ve-category datasets for each of our four authors (see below), we found that in each case, either the most negative or the most positive class (but not both) contained only about 5% of the documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:189	To make the classes more balanced, we folded these minority classes into the adjacent class, thus arriving at a four-class problem (categories 0-3, increasing in positivity)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:189	Note that the four-class problem seems to offer more possibilities for leveraging class relationship information than the three-class setting, since it involves more class pairs." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="41:189	Also, even the two-category version of the rating-inference problem for movie reviews has proven quite challenging for many automated classi cation techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002; Turney, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:189	We applied the above two labeling schemes to a scale dataset3 containing four corpora of movie reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:189	All reviews were automatically preprocessed to remove both explicit rating indicators and objective sentences; the motivation for the latter step is that it has previously aided positive vs. negative classi cation (Pang and Lee, 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:189	All of the 1770, 902, 1307, or 1027 documents in a given corpus were written by the same author." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:189	This decision facilitates interpretation of the results, since it factors out the effects of different choices of methods for calibrating authors scales.4 We point out that but since our goal is to recover a reviewers true recommendation, reader-author agreement is more relevant." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:189	While another factor might be degree of English uency, in an informal experiment (six subjects viewing the same three pairs), native English speakers made the only two errors." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="50:189	For other critics, 2.5 stars can either be positive it is possible to gather author-speci c information in some practical applications: for instance, systems that use selected authors (e.g. , the Rotten Tomatoes movie-review website where, we note, not all authors provide explicit ratings) could require that someone submit rating-labeled samples of newlyadmitted authors work." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:169	In this paper we confront the task of deciding whether a given term has a positive connotation, or a negative connotation, or has no subjective connotation at all; this problem thus subsumes the problem of determining subjectivity and the problem of determining orientation." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="115:169	Terms that have been classified both into Positive by the former classifier and into (not Negative) by the latter are deemed to be positive, and terms that have been classified both into (not Positive) by the former classifier and into Negative by the latter are deemed to be negative." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="121:169	A first difference, of a conceptual nature, is that only Approaches I and III view Objective as a category, or concept, in its own right, while Approach II views objectivity as a nonexistent entity, i.e. as the absence of subjectivity (in fact, in Approach II the training examples of Objective are only used as training examples of the complements of Positive and Negative)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:169	Asecond difference isthatApproaches Iand II are based on standard binary classification technology, while Approach III requires multiclass (i.e. 1-of-m) classification." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="138:169	This hypothesis is confirmed by an experiment performed by Kim and Hovy (2004) on testing the agreement of two human coders at tagging words with the Positive, Negative, and Objective labels." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="139:169	The authors define two measures of such agreement: strict agreement, equivalent to our PNO-accuracy, and lenient agreement, which measures the accuracy at telling Negative against the rest." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="140:169	For any experiment, strict agreement values are then going to be, by definition, lower or equal than the corresponding lenient ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="141:169	Theauthors use two sets of 462 adjectives and 502 verbs, respectively, randomly extracted from the basic English word list of the TOEFL test." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:213	Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words." ></td>
	<td class="line o" title="17:213	These techniques were applied and examined in different domains, such as customer reviews (Hu and Liu 2004) and news articles 1." ></td>
	<td class="line o" title="18:213	These researchers use lists of opinion-bearing clue words and phrases, and then apply various additional techniques and refinements." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:213	Along with many opinion researchers, we participated in a large pilot study, sponsored by NIST, which concluded that it is very difficult to define what an opinion is in general." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:213	Moreover, an expression that is considered as an opinion in one domain might not be an opinion in another." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:213	For example, the statement The screen is very big might be a positive review for a wide screen desktop review, but it could be a mere fact in general newspaper text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:213	This implies that it is hard to apply opinion bearing words collected from one domain to an application for another domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:213	One might therefore need to collect opinion clues within individual domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:213	In case we cannot simply find training data from existing sources, such as news article analysis, we need to manually annotate data first." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:213	Most opinions are of two kinds: 1) beliefs about the world, with values such as true, false, possible, unlikely, etc. and 2) judgments about the world, with values such as good, bad, neutral, wise, foolish, virtuous, etc. Statements like I believe that he is smart and Stock prices will rise soon are examples of beliefs whereas I like the new policy on social security and Unfortunately this really was his year: despite a stagnant economy, he still won his re-election are examples of judgment opinions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="35:213	The holder of an opinion is the person, organization or group whose opinion is expressed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:213	Finally, the topic is the event or entity about which the opinion is held." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:213	In previous work, Choi et al.(2005) identify opinion holders (sources) using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and extraction patterns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:213	They define the opinion holder identification problem as a sequence tagging task: given a sequence of words ( n xxxL 21 ) in a sentence, they generate a sequence of labels ( n yyyL 21 ) indicating whether the word is a holder or not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:213	However, there are many cases where multiple opinions are expressed in a sentence each with its own holder." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:213	In those cases, finding opinion holders for each individual expression is necessary." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="43:213	This implies that multiple opinion expressions in a sentence occur significantly often." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:213	A major challenge of our work is therefore not only to focus on sentence with only one opinion, but also to identify opinion holders when there is more than one opinion expressed in a sentence." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="54:213	In the next section, we describe our methodology addressing the three steps described above, and in Section 4 we present our experimental results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:213	We conclude with a discussion of future work." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="57:213	Then, in Section 2.2, we describe our algorithm for identifying opinion holders." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:213	In Section 3, we show how to use our methodology for detecting opinions in short emails." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:213	2.1 Detecting Opinion-Bearing Words and Identifying Valence We introduce an algorithm to classify a word as being positive, negative, or neutral classes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:213	This classifier can be used for any set of words of interest and the resulting words with their valence tags can help in developing new applications such as a public opinion monitoring system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:213	We define an opinion-bearing word as a word that carries a positive or negative sentiment directly such as good, bad, foolish, virtuous, etc. In other words, this is the smallest unit of opinion that can thereafter be used as a clue for sentence-level or text-level opinion detection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:213	We treat word sentiment classification into Positive, Negative, and Neutral as a three-way classification problem instead of a two-way classification problem of Positive and Negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:213	By adding the third class, Neutral, we can prevent the classifier from assigning either positive or negative sentiment to weak opinion-bearing words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:213	For example, the word central that Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) included as a positive adjective is not classified as positive in our system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:213	Instead 201 we mark it as neutral since it is a weak clue for an opinion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:213	If an unknown word has a strong relationship with the neutral class, we can therefore classify it as neutral even if it has some small connotation of Positive or Negative as well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:213	Approach: We built a word sentiment classifier using WordNet and three sets of positive, negative, and neutral words tagged by hand." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:213	Our insight is that synonyms of positive words tend to have positive sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:213	We expanded those manually selected seed words of each sentiment class by collecting synonyms from WordNet." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:213	However, we cannot simply assume that all the synonyms of positive words are positive since most words could have synonym relationships with all three sentiment classes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:213	This requires us to calculate the closeness of a given word to each category and determine the most probable class." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:213	The following formula describes our model for determining the category of a word: (1) ),|(maxarg)|(maxarg 21 n cc synsynsyncPwcP  where c is a category (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) and w is a given word; syn n is a WordNet synonym of the word w.

In section 4.1, we describe our manually annotated dataset which we used for seed words and for our evaluation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:213	2.2 Identifying Opinion Holders Despite successes in identifying opinion expressions and subjective words/phrases (See Section 1), there has been less achievement on the factors closely related to subjectivity and polarity, such as identifying the opinion holder." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:213	However, our research indicates that without this information, it is difficult, if not impossible, to define opinion accurately enough to obtain reasonable interannotator agreement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:213	Since these factors co-occur and mutually reinforce each other, the question Who is the holder of this opinion? is as important as Is this an opinion? or What kind of opinion is expressed here?." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:213	In this section, we describe the automated identification for opinion holders." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:213	We define an opinion holder as an entity (person, organization, country, or special group of people) who expresses explicitly or implicitly the opinion contained in the sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:213	Previous work that is related to opinion holder identification is (Bethard et al. 2004) who identify opinion propositions and holders." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:213	However, their opinion is restricted to propositional opinion and mostly to verbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:213	Another related work is (Choi et al. 2005) who use the MPQA corpus 2 to learn patterns of opinion sources using a graphical model and extraction pattern learning." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:213	However, they have a different task definition from ours." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:213	They define the task as identifying opinion sources (holders) given a sentence, whereas we define it as identifying opinion sources given an opinion expression in a sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:213	We discussed their work in Section 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:213	Data: As training data, we used the MPQA corpus (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003), which contains news articles manually annotated by 5 trained annotators." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:213	They annotated 10657 sentences from 535 documents, in four different aspects: agent, expressive-subjectivity, on, and inside." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:213	Expressivesubjectivity marks words and phrases that indirectly express a private state that is defined as a term for opinions, evaluations, emotions, and speculations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:213	The on annotation is used to mark speech events and direct expressions of private states." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:213	As for the holder, we use the agent of the selected private states or speech events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:213	While there are many possible ways to define what opinion means, intuitively, given an opinion, it is clear what the opinion holder means." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:213	Table 1 shows an example of the annotation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:213	In this example, we consider the expression the U.S. government is the source of evil in the world with an expres2 http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~wiebe/pubs/ardasummer02/ Sentence Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, responding to Bushs axis of evil remark, said the U.S. government is the source of evil in the world." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="93:213	Approach: Since more than one opinion may be expressed in a sentence, we have to find an opinion holder for each opinion expression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:213	For example, in a sentence A thinks Bs criticism of T is wrong, B is the holder of the criticism of T, whereas A is the person who has an opinion that Bs criticism is wrong." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:213	Therefore, we define our task as finding an opinion holder, given an opinion expression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:213	Our earlier work (ref suppressed) focused on identifying opinion expressions within text." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="206:231	The results show that: (1) the learned mappings provide good coverage of the domain ontology and exhibit good linguistic variation; (2) the consistency between the semantic representations and realizations is high; and (3) the naturalnessof the realizations are significantly higher than the baseline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="207:231	There are also limitations in our method." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="208:231	Even though consistency is rated highly by human subjects, this may actually be a judgement of whether the polarity of the learned mapping is correctly placed on the 1 to 5 rating scale." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="209:231	Thus, alternate ways of expressing, for example foodquality=5, shown in Table 7, cannot be guaranteed to be synonymous, which may be required for use in spoken language generation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="210:231	Rather, an examination of the adjectival phrases in Table 7 shows that different aspects of the food are discussed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="211:231	For example ample and plentiful refer to the portion size, fancy may refer to the presentation, and delicious describes the flavors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="212:231	This suggests that perhaps the ontology would benefit from representing these sub-attributes of the food attribute, and sub-attributes in general." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="213:231	Another problem with consistency is that the same AP, e.g. very good in Table 7 may appear with multiple ratings." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="214:231	For example, very good is used for every foodquality rating from 2 to 5." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="215:231	Thus some further automatic or by-hand analysis is required to refine what is learned before actual use in spoken language generation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="216:231	Still, our method could reduce the amount of time a system designer spends developing the spoken language generator, and increase the naturalness of spoken language generation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="217:231	Another issue is that the recall appears to be quite low given that all of the sentences concern the same domain: only 2.4% of the sentences could be used to create the mappings." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="218:231	One way to increase recall might be to automatically augment the list of distinguished attribute lexicalizations, using WordNet or work on automatic identification of synonyms, such as (Lin and Pantel, 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="219:231	However, the method here has high precision, and automatic techniques may introduce noise." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="220:231	A related issue is that the filters are in some cases too strict." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="221:231	For example the contextual filter is based on POS-tags, so that sentences that do not require the prior context for their interpretation are eliminated, such as sentences containing subordinating conjunctions like because, when, if, whose arguments are both given in the same sentence (Prasad et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="222:231	In addition, recall is affected by the domain ontology, and the automatically constructed domain ontology from the review webpages may not cover all of the domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="223:231	In some review domains, the attributes that get individual ratings are a limited subset of the domain ontology." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="224:231	Techniques for automatic feature identification (Hu and Liu, 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) could possibly help here, although these techniques currently have the limitation that they do not automatically identify different lexicalizations of the same feature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="225:231	A different type of limitation is that dialogue systems need to generate utterances for information gathering whereas the mappings we obtained 271 can only be used for information presentation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="226:231	Thus these would have to be constructed by hand, as in current practice, or perhaps other types of corpora or resources could be utilized." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:194	There are several benefits that would motivate such a joint exploration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:194	First, at the resource level, the augmentation of lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) with subjectivity labels could support better subjectivity analysis tools, and principled methods for refining word senses and clustering similar meanings." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="18:194	To address this question, the output of a subjectivity sentence classifier is input to a word-sense disambiguation system, which is in turn evaluated on the nouns from the SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task (Section 5)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="65:288	Our idea is to use certain layout structures and linguistic pattern in order to extract opinion sentences from HTML documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:288	More specifically, we used two kinds of layout structures: the itemization and the table." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:288	In what follows, we explain examples where opinion sentences can be extracted by using the itemization, table and linguistic pattern." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:288	3.1 Itemization The first idea is to extract opinion sentences from the itemization (Figure 1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:288	In this Figure, opinions about a music player are itemized and these itemizations have headers such as pros and cons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:288	By using the headers, we can recognize that opinion sentences are described in these itemizations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:288	Pros: AF The sound is natural." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:288	AF Music is easy to find." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:288	AF Can enjoy creating my favorite play-lists." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:288	Cons: AF The remote controller does not have an LCD display." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:288	AF The body gets scratched and fingerprinted easily." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:288	AF The battery drains quickly when using the backlight." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:288	Figure 1: Opinion sentences in itemization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:288	Hereafter, such phrases that indicate the pres453 ence of opinion sentences are called indicators." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:288	Indicators for positive sentences are called positive indicators." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:288	Pros is an example of positive indicator." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:288	Similarly, indicators for negative sentences are called negative indicators." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:288	3.2 Table The second idea is to use the table structure (Figure 2)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:288	In this Figure, a car review is summarized in the table." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:288	Mileage(urban) 7.0km/litter Mileage(highway) 9.0km/litter Plus This is a four door car, but its so cool." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:288	Minus The seat is ragged and the light is dark." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:288	Figure 2: Opinion sentences in table." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:288	We can predict that there are opinion sentences in this table, because the left column acts as a header and there are indicators (plus and minus) in that column." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:288	3.3 Linguistic pattern The third idea is based on linguistic pattern." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:288	Because we treat Japanese, the pattern that is discussed in this paper depends on Japanese grammar although we think there are similar patterns in other languages including English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:288	Consider the Japanese sentences attached with English translations (Figure 3)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:288	Japanese sentences are written in italics and - denotes that the word is followed by postpositional particles." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:288	For example, software-no means that software is followed by postpositional particle no." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:288	Translations of each word and the entire sentence are represented below the original Japanese sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:288	-POST means postpositional particle." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:288	In the examples, we focused on the singly underlined phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:288	Roughly speaking, they correspond to the advantage/weakness is to in English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:288	In these phrases, indicators (riten (advantage) and ketten (weakness)) are followed by postpositional particle -ha, which is topic marker." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:288	And hence, we can recognize that something good (or bad) is the topic of the sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:288	Based on this observation, we crafted a linguistic pattern that can detect the singly underlined phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:288	And then, we extracted doubly underlined phrases as opinions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:288	They correspond to run quickly and take too much time." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:288	The detail of this process is discussed in the next Section." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:288	4 Automatic Corpus Construction This Section represents the detail of the corpus construction procedure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:288	As shown in the previous Section, our idea utilizes the indicator, and it is important to recognize indicators in HTML documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:288	To do this, we manually crafted lexicon, in which positive and negative indicators are listed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:288	This lexicon consists of 303 positive and 433 negative indicators." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:288	Using this lexicon, the polarity-tagged corpus is constructed from HTML documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:288	The method consists of the following three steps: 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:288	Preprocessing Before extracting opinion sentences, HTML documents are preprocessed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:288	This process involves separating texts form HTML tags, recognizing sentence boundary, and complementing omitted HTML tags etc. 2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:288	Opinion sentence extraction Opinion sentences are extracted from HTML documents by using the itemization, table and linguistic pattern." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:288	3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:288	Filtering Since HTML documents are noisy, some of the extracted opinion sentences are not appropriate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="114:288	They are removed in this step." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="115:288	For the preprocessing, we implemented simple rule-based system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="116:288	We cannot explain its detail for lack of space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="117:288	In the remainder of this Section, we describe three extraction methods respectively, and then examine filtering technique." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="118:288	4.1 Extraction based on itemization The first method utilizes the itemization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="119:288	In order to extract opinion sentences, first of all, we have to find such itemization as illustrated in Figure 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="120:288	They are detected by using indicator lexicon and HTML tags such as BOh1BQ and BOulBQ etc. After finding the itemizations, the sentences in the items are extracted as opinion sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:288	Their polarity labels are assigned according to whether the header is positive or negative indicator." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:288	From the itemization in Figure 1, three positive sentences and three negative ones are extracted." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="123:288	The problem here is how to treat such item that has more than one sentences (Figure 4)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="124:288	In this itemization, there are two sentences in each of the 454 (1) kono software-no riten-ha hayaku ugoku koto this software-POST advantage-POST quickly run to The advantage of this software is to run quickly." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:254	We first demonstrate that review identification can be performed with high accuracy using only unigrams as features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:254	We then examine the role of four types of simple linguistic knowledge sources in a polarity classification system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:254	1 Introduction Sentiment analysis involves the identification of positive and negative opinions from a text segment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:254	The task has recently received a lot of attention, with applications ranging from multiperspective question-answering (e.g. , Cardie et al.(2004)) to opinion-oriented information extraction (e.g. , Riloff et al.(2005)) and summarization (e.g. , Hu and Liu (2004))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:254	Research in sentiment analysis has generally proceeded at three levels, aiming to identify and classify opinions from documents, sentences, and phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:254	This paper examines two problems in document-level sentiment analysis, focusing on analyzing a particular type of opinionated documents: reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:254	The first problem, polarity classification, has the goal of determining a reviews polarity positive ( thumbs up ) or negative ( thumbs down )." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:254	Recent work has expanded the polarity classification task to additionally handle documents expressing a neutral sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:254	Although studied fairly extensively, polarity classification remains a challenge to natural language processing systems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:254	We will focus on an important linguistic aspect of polarity classification: examining the role of a variety of simple, yet under-investigated, linguistic knowledge sources in a learning-based polarity classification system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:254	Specifically, we will show how to build a high-performing polarity classifier by exploiting information provided by (1) high order n-grams, (2) a lexicon composed of adjectives manually annotated with their polarity information (e.g. , happy is annotated as positive and terrible as negative), (3) dependency relations derived from dependency parses, and (4) objective terms and phrases extracted from neutral documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:254	As mentioned above, the majority of work on document-level sentiment analysis to date has focused on polarity classification, assuming as input a set of reviews to be classified." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:254	A relevant question is: what if we dont know that an input document is a review in the first place?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:254	The second task we will examine in this paper review identification attempts to address this question." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:254	Specifically, review identification seeks to determine whether a given document is a review or not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:254	We view both review identification and polarity classification as a classification task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:254	For review identification, we train a classifier to distinguish movie reviews and movie-related nonreviews (e.g. , movie ads, plot summaries) using only unigrams as features, obtaining an accuracy of over 99% via 10-fold cross-validation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:254	Similar experiments using documents from the book domain also yield an accuracy as high as 97%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:254	An analysis of the results reveals that the high accuracy can be attributed to the difference in the vocabulary employed in reviews and non-reviews: while reviews can be composed of a mixture of subjective and objective language, our non-review documents rarely contain subjective expressions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:254	Next, we learn our polarity classifier using positive and negative reviews taken from two movie 611 review datasets, one assembled by Pang and Lee (2004) and the other by ourselves." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:254	The resulting classifier, when trained on a feature set derived from the four types of linguistic knowledge sources mentioned above, achieves a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 90.5% and 86.1% on Pang et al.s dataset and ours, respectively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:254	To our knowledge, our result on Pang et al.s dataset is one of the best reported to date." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:254	Perhaps more importantly, an analysis of these results show that the various types of features interact in an interesting manner, allowing us to draw conclusions that provide new insights into polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:254	2 Related Work 2.1 Review Identification As noted in the introduction, while a review can contain both subjective and objective phrases, our non-reviews are essentially factual documents in which subjective expressions can rarely be found." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:254	Hence, review identification can be viewed as an instance of the broader task of classifying whether a document is mostly factual/objective or mostly opinionated/subjective." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:254	There have been attempts on tackling this so-called document-level subjectivity classification task, with very encouraging results (see Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) and Wiebe et al.(2004) for details)." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="32:254	2.2 Polarity Classification There is a large body of work on classifying the polarity of a document (e.g. , Pang et al.(2002), Turney (2002)), a sentence (e.g. , Liu et al.(2003), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Kim and Hovy (2004), Gamon et al.(2005)), a phrase (e.g. , Wilson et al.(2005)), and a specific object (such as a product) mentioned in a document (e.g. , Morinaga et al.(2002), Yi et al.(2003), Popescu and Etzioni (2005))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:254	Below we will center our discussion of related work around the four types of features we will explore for polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:254	Higher-order n-grams." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:254	While n-grams offer a simple way of capturing context, previous work has rarely explored the use of n-grams as features in a polarity classification system beyond unigrams." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:254	Two notable exceptions are the work of Dave et al.(2003) and Pang et al.(2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:254	Interestingly, while Dave et al. report good performance on classifying reviews using bigrams or trigrams alone, Pang et al. show that bigrams are not useful features for the task, whether they are used in isolation or in conjunction with unigrams." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:254	This motivates us to take a closer look at the utility of higher-order n-grams in polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:254	Manually-tagged term polarity." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="48:254	Much work has been performed on learning to identify and classify polarity terms (i.e. , terms expressing a positive sentiment (e.g. , happy) or a negative sentiment (e.g. , terrible)) and exploiting them to do polarity classification (e.g. , Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), Turney (2002), Kim and Hovy (2004), Whitelaw et al.(2005), Esuli and Sebastiani (2005))." ></td>
	<td class="line n" title="50:254	Though reasonably successful, these (semi-)automatic techniques often yield lexicons that have either high coverage/low precision or low coverage/high precision." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:254	While manually constructed positive and negative word lists exist (e.g. , General Inquirer1), they too suffer from the problem of having low coverage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:254	This prompts us to manually construct our own polarity word lists2 and study their use in polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:254	Dependency relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:254	There have been several attempts at extracting features for polarity classification from dependency parses, but most focus on extracting specific types of information such as adjective-noun relations (e.g. , Dave et al.(2003), Yi et al.(2003)) or nouns that enjoy a dependency relation with a polarity term (e.g. , Popescu and Etzioni (2005))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:254	Wilson et al.(2005) extract a larger variety of features from dependency parses, but unlike us, their goal is to determine the polarity of a phrase, not a document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:254	In comparison to previous work, we investigate the use of a larger set of dependency relations for classifying reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:254	Objective information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:254	The objective portions of a review do not contain the authors opinion; hence features extracted from objective sentences and phrases are irrelevant with respect to the polarity classification task and their presence may complicate the learning task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:254	Indeed, recent work has shown that benefits can be made by first separating facts from opinions in a document (e.g, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)) and classifying the polarity based solely on the subjective portions of the document (e.g. , Pang and Lee (2004))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:254	Motivated by the work of Koppel and Schler (2005), we identify and extract objective material from nonreviews and show how to exploit such information in polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:254	1http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/inquirer/ spreadsheet guid.htm 2Wilson et al.(2005) have also manually tagged a list of terms with their polarity, but this list is not publicly available." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:254	612 Finally, previous work has also investigated features that do not fall into any of the above categories." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="67:254	For instance, instead of representing the polarity of a term using a binary value, Mullen and Collier (2004) use Turneys (2002) method to assign a real value to represent term polarity and introduce a variety of numerical features that are aggregate measures of the polarity values of terms selected from the document under consideration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:254	3 Review Identification Recall that the goal of review identification is to determine whether a given document is a review or not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:254	Given this definition, two immediate questions come to mind." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:254	First, should this problem be addressed in a domain-specific or domainindependent manner?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:254	In other words, should a review identification system take as input documents coming from the same domain or not?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:254	Apparently this is a design question with no definite answer, but our decision is to perform domain-specific review identification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:254	The reason is that the primary motivation of review identification is the need to identify reviews for further analysis by a polarity classification system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:254	Since polarity classification has almost exclusively been addressed in a domain-specific fashion, it seems natural that its immediate upstream component review identification should also assume domain specificity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:254	Note, however, that assuming domain specificity is not a self-imposed limitation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:254	In fact, we envision that the review identification system will have as its upstream component a text classification system, which will classify documents by topic and pass to the review identifier only those documents that fall within its domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:254	Given our choice of domain specificity, the next question is: which documents are non-reviews?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:254	Here, we adopt a simple and natural definition: a non-review is any document that belongs to the given domain but is not a review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:254	Dataset." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:254	Now, recall from the introduction that we cast review identification as a classification task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:254	To train and test our review identifier, we use 2000 reviews and 2000 non-reviews from the movie domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:254	The 2000 reviews are taken from Pang et al.s polarity dataset (version 2.0)3, which consists of an equal number of positive and negative reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:254	We collect the non-reviews for the 3Available from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ people/pabo/movie-review-data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:254	movie domain from the Internet Movie Database website4, randomly selecting any documents from this site that are on the movie topic but are not reviews themselves." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:254	With this criterion in mind, the 2000 non-review documents we end up with are either movie ads or plot summaries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:254	Training and testing the review identifier." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:254	We perform 10-fold cross-validation (CV) experiments on the above dataset, using Joachims (1999) SVMlight package5 to train an SVM classifier for distinguishing reviews and non-reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:254	All learning parameters are set to their default values.6 Each document is first tokenized and downcased, and then represented as a vector of unigrams with length normalization.7 Following Pang et al.(2002), we use frequency as presence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:254	In other words, the ith element of the document vector is 1 if the corresponding unigram is present in the document and 0 otherwise." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:254	The resulting classifier achieves an accuracy of 99.8%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:254	Classifying neutral reviews and non-reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:254	Admittedly, the high accuracy achieved using such a simple set of features is somewhat surprising, although it is consistent with previous results on document-level subjectivity classification in which accuracies of 94-97% were obtained (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wiebe et al. , 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:254	Before concluding that review classification is an easy task, we conduct an additional experiment: we train a review identifier on a new dataset where we keep the same 2000 non-reviews but replace the positive/negative reviews with 2000 neutral reviews (i.e. , reviews with a mediocre rating)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:254	Intuitively, a neutral review contains fewer terms with strong polarity than a positive/negative review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:254	Hence, this additional experiment would allow us to investigate whether the lack of strong polarized terms in neutral reviews would increase the difficulty of the learning task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:254	Our neutral reviews are randomly chosen from Pang et al.s pool of 27886 unprocessed movie reviews8 that have either a rating of 2 (on a 4-point scale) or 2.5 (on a 5-point scale)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="100:254	6We tried polynomial and RBF kernels, but none yields better performance than the default linear kernel." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:254	7We observed that not performing length normalization hurts performance slightly." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="105:254	When trained on this new dataset, the review identifier also achieves an accuracy of 99.8%, suggesting that this learning task isnt any harder in comparison to the previous one." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:254	Discussion." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:160	Our approach is to view affective states (such as happy, angry) as locations in Osgoods Evaluation-Activation (EA) space (Osgood et aal., 1957), and draws on work in psychology which has a long history of work seeking to construct a typology of such affective states (Scherer, 1984)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:160	A similar approach has been used more recently to describe emotional states that are expressed in speech (Cowie and Cornelius, 2002; Schrcurrency1oder and Cowie, 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:160	Our overall aim is to determine the extent to which such a typology can be validated and applied to the task of text classi cation using automatic methods." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:160	In this paper we describe some initial experiments aimed at validating a basic two dimensional classi cation of weblog data, rst with Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary classi ers, then with Pointwise Mutual Information Information Retrieval (PMI-IR)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:160	The domain of weblog posts is particularly well-suited for this task given its highly subjective nature and the availability of data, including data which has been author-annotated for mood, which is a reasonable approximation of affect." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:160	Recent attempts to classify weblog posts have shown modest, but consistent improvements over a 50% baseline, only slightly worse than human performance (Mishne, 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:160	One important milestone is the elaboration of a typology of affective states." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:160	To devise such a typology, our starting point is Figure 1, which is based on a model of emotion as a multicomponent process (Scherer, 1984)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:160	In this model, the distribution of the affective states is the result of analysing similarity judgments by humans for 235 emotion terms1 using cluster-analysis and multidimensional scaling techniques to map out the structure as a twodimensional space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:160	The positioning of words is not so much controversial as fuzzy; an affective state such as angry to describe facial expression in speech may have a slightly different location than an angry weblog post." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:160	In this model, the well-studied sentiment classi cation is simply a speci c case (left vs. right halves of the space)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:160	The experiments we describe here seek to go beyond this basic distinction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:160	They involve an additional dimension of affect, the activity dimension, allowing textual data to be classi ed into four categories corresponding to each of the four quad1Reduced to less than 100 in Figure 1." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:187	1 Introduction Why do researchers cite a particular paper?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:187	This is a question that has interested researchers in discourse analysis, sociology of science, and information sciences (library sciences) for decades (Gar eld, 1979; Small, 1982; White, 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:187	Many annotation schemes for citation motivation have been created over the years, and the question has been studied in detail, even to the level of in-depth interviews with writers about each individual citation (Hodges, 1972)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:187	Part of this sustained interest in citations can be explained by the fact that bibliometric metrics are commonly used to measure the impact of a researchers work by how often they are cited (Borgman, 1990; Luukkonen, 1992)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:187	However, researchers from the eld of discourse studies have long criticised purely quantitative citation analysis, pointing out that many citations are done out of politeness, policy or piety (Ziman, 1968), and that criticising citations or citations in passing should not count as much as central citations in a paper, or as those citations where a researchers work is used as the starting point of somebody elses work (Bonzi, 1982)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:187	A plethora of manual annotation schemes for citation motivation have been invented over the years (Gar eld, 1979; Hodges, 1972; Chubin and Moitra, 1975)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:187	Other schemes concentrate on citation function (Spiegel-Rcurrency1using, 1977; OConnor, 1982; Weinstock, 1971; Swales, 1990; Small, 1982))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:187	One of the best-known of these studies (Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975) divides citations in running text into four dimensions: conceptual or operational use (i.e. , use of theory vs. use of technical method); evolutionary or juxtapositional (i.e. , own work is based on the cited work vs. own work is an alternative to it); organic or perfunctory (i.e. , work is crucially needed for understanding of citing article or just a general acknowledgement); and nally con rmative vs. negational (i.e. , is the correctness of the ndings disputed?)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:187	They found, for example, that 40% of the citations were perfunctory, which casts further doubt on the citationcounting approach." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:187	Nevertheless, researchers in the eld of citation content analysis do not normally cross-validate their schemes with independent annotation studies with other human annotators, and usually only annotate a small number of citations (in the range of hundreds or thousands)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:223	To date, research in the area (see Related Work section) has focused on the problem of extracting sentiment both at the document level (coarse-grained sentiment information), and at the level of sentences, clauses, or individual expressions (finegrained sentiment information)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:229	In this paper, we propose several sentiment information retrieval models in the framework of probabilistic language models, assuming that a user both inputs query terms expressing a certain topic and also specifies a sentiment polarity of interest in some manner." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:229	Our experiments prove that our models are effective." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:229	1 Introduction The recent rapid expansion of access to information has significantly increased the demands on retrieval or classification of sentiment information from a large amount of textual data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:229	The field of sentiment classification has recently received considerable attention, where the polarities of sentiment, such as positive or negative, were identified from unstructured text (Shanahan et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:229	A number of studies have investigated sentiment classification at document level, e.g., (Pang et al. , 2002; Dave et al. , 2003), and at sentence level, e.g., (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Nigam and Hurst, 2005); however, the accuracy is still less than desirable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:229	Therefore, ranking according to the likelihood of containing sentiment information is expected to serve a crucial function in helping users." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:229	We believe that our work is the first attempt at sentiment retrieval that aims at finding sentences containing information with a specific sentiment polarity on a certain topic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:229	Intuitively, the expression of sentiment in text is dependent on the topic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:229	For example, a negative view for some voting event may be expressed using flaw, while a negative view for some politician may be expressed using reckless." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:229	Moreover, sentiment polarities are also dependent on topics or domains." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="14:229	For example, the adjective unpredictable may have a negative orientation in an automotive review, in a phrase such as unpredictable steering, but it could have a positive orientation in a movie review, in a phrase such as unpredictable plot, as mentioned in (Turney, 2002) in the context of his sentiment word detection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:229	We propose sentiment retrieval models in the framework of generative language modeling, not only assuming query terms expressing a certain topic, but also assuming that the polarity of sentiment interest is specified by the user in some manner, where the topic dependence of the sentiment is considered." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:229	To the best of our knowledge, there have been no other studies on a retrieval model unifying both topic and sentiment, and further, there have been no other studies on sentiment retrieval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:229	The sentiment information often appears as local in a document, and therefore focusing on finer levels, i.e., sentence or passage levels rather than document level, is crucial." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="42:229	We assume that the content of an individual statement can be modeled independently of all other statements in the collection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:229	Each statement consists of some topicbearing and some sentiment-bearing words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:229	We assume that the topic-bearing words represent exchangeable samples from some underlying topic language model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:229	Exchangeability means that the relative order of the words is irrelevant, but the words are not independent of each otherthe idea often stated as a bag-of-words assumption." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:229	Similarly, sentiment-bearing words are viewed as an order-invariant bag, sampled from the underlying sentiment language model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:229	We will explicitly model dependency between the topic and sentiment language models, and will demonstrate that treating them independently leads to sub-optimal retrieval performance." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:189	In contrast with ranking search results, assessing relevance when ranking reviews is of little importance because reviews are directly associated with the relevant product or service." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:189	Instead, a key challenge when ranking reviews is to determine which reviews the customers will find helpful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:189	Most websites currently rank reviews by their recency or product rating (e.g. , number of stars in Amazon.com reviews)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:189	Recently, more sophisticated ranking schemes measure reviews by their helpfulness, which is typically estimated by having users manually assess it." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="25:189	Helpfulness, on the other hand, is valuable to assess because it is not explicitly known in current approaches until many users vote on the helpfulness of a review." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="53:189	Below we describe each feature class in turn." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:189	Structural Features Structural features are observations of the document structure and formatting." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:189	Lexical Features Lexical features capture the words observed in the reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:189	We experimented with two sets of features:  Unigram (UGR): The tf-idf statistic of each word occurring in a review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:189	 Bigram (BGR): The tf-idf statistic of each bigram occurring in a review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:189	For both unigrams and bigrams, we used lemmatized words from a syntactic analysis of the reviews and computed the tf-idf statistic (Salton and McGill 1983) using the following formula: () N idftf idftf log = where N is the number of tokens in the review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:189	Syntactic Features Syntactic features aim to capture the linguistic properties of the review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:189	We grouped them into the following feature set:  Syntax (SYN): Includes the percentage of parsed tokens that are open-class (i.e. , nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), the percentage of tokens that are nouns, the percentage of tokens that are verbs, the percentage of tokens that are verbs conjugated in the first person, and the percentage of tokens that are adjectives or adverbs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:189	Semantic Features Most online reviews are fairly short; their sparsity suggests that bigram features will not perform well (which is supported by our experiments described in Section 5.3)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:189	Although semantic features have rarely been effective in many text classification problems (Moschitti and Basili 2004), there is reason here to hypothesize that a specialized vocabulary of important words might help with the sparsity." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="69:189	that good reviews will often contain: i) references to the features of a product (e.g. , the LCD and resolution of a digital camera), and ii) mentions of sentiment words (i.e. , words that express an opinion such as great screen)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:189	Below we describe two families of features that capture these semantic observations within the reviews:  Product-Feature (PRF): The features of products that occur in the review, e.g., capacity of MP3 players and zoom of a digital camera." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="86:189	Though learning to rank according to helpfulness requires only SVM Ranking, the helpfulness function provides non-uniform differences between ranks in the training set." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="12:290	One consists of opinions such as I like/dislike it, and the other consists of opinions like It is likely/unlikely to happen. We call the first category Judgment Opinions and the second (those discussing the future) Predictive Opinions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:290	Judgment opinions express positive or negative sentiment about a topic such as, for example, reviews about cameras, movies, books, or hotels, and discussions about topics like abortion and war." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:290	In contrast, predictive opinions express a person's opinion about the future of a topic or event such as the housing market, a popular sports match, and national election, based on his or her belief and knowledge." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:290	Due to the different nature of these two categories of opinion, each has different valences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:290	Judgment opinions have core valences of positive and negative." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="18:290	Predictive opinions have the core valence of likely or unlikely predicated on the event." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:290	For example, a sentence Housing prices will go down soon carries the valence of likely for the event of housing prices go down." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="21:290	The sentence I like Democrats but I think they are not likely to win considering the war issue contains both types of opinion: positive valence towards Democrats and unlikely valence towards the event of Democrats wins." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="23:290	Note that our work is different from predictive data mining which models a data mining system using statistical approaches in order to forecast the future or trace a pattern of interest (Rickel and Porter, 1997; Rodionov and Martin, 1996)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:239	Our experiments on Japanese weblog posts show that the use of contextual clues improve the performance for both tasks." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="10:239	Previous approaches to the task of mining a largescale document collection of customer opinions (or  Currently, NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, 1-1, Hikarinooka, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, 239-0847 Japan reviews) can be classified into two approaches: Document classification and information extraction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:239	The former is the task of classifying documents or passages according to their semantic orientation such as positive vs. negative." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="12:239	This direction has been forming the mainstream of research on opinion-sensitive text processing (Pang et al. , 2002; Turney, 2002, etc.)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="15:239	In contrast to sentiment classification, opinion extraction aims at producing richer information and requires an indepth analysis of opinions, which has only recently been attempted by a growing but still relatively small research community (Yi et al. , 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005, etc.)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:239	Most previous work on customer opinion extraction assumes the source of information to be customer reviews collected from customer review sites (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:239	In contrast, in this paper, we consider the task of extracting customer opinions from unstructured weblog posts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:239	Compared with extraction from review articles, extraction from weblogs is more challenging because weblog posts tend to exhibit greater diversity in topics, goals, vocabulary, style, etc. and are much more likely to include descriptions irrelevant to the subject in question." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:239	In this paper, we first describe our task setting of opinion extraction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:239	We conducted a corpus study and investigated the feasibility of the task def1065 inition by showing the statistics and inter-annotator agreement of our corpus annotation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:239	Next, we show that the crucial body of the above opinion extraction task can be decomposed into two kinds of relation extraction, i.e. aspect-evaluation relation extraction and aspect-of relation extraction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:239	For example, the passage I went out for lunch at the Deli and ordered a curry with chicken." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:239	It was pretty good has an aspect-evaluation relation curry with chicken, was good and an aspect-of relation The Deli, curry with the chicken." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:239	The former task can be regarded as a special type of predicate-argument structure analysis or semantic role labeling." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:239	The latter, on the other hand, can be regarded as bridging reference resolution (Clark, 1977), which is the task of identifying relations between definite noun phrases and discourse-new entities implicitly related to some previously mentioned entities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:239	Most of the previous work on customer opinion extraction, however, does not adopt the state-of-theart techniques in those fields, relying only on simple proximity-based or pattern-based methods." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:239	In this context, this paper empirically shows that incorporating machine learning-based techniques devised for predicate-argument structure analysis and bridging reference resolution improve the performance of both aspect-evaluation and aspect-of relation extraction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:239	Furthermore, we also show that combining contextual clues with a common co-occurrence statistics-based technique for bridging reference resolution makes a significant improvement on aspectof relation extraction." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:201	In this work, to measure the strength and polarity of an opinion, we consider the economic context in which the opinion is evaluated, instead of using human annotators or linguistic resources." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:201	We rely on the fact that text in on-line systems influences the behavior of humans and this effect can be observed using some easy-to-measure economic variables, such as revenues or product prices." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:201	In effect, we use econometrics to identify the economic value of text and assign a dollar value to each opinion phrase, measuring sentiment effectively and without the need for manual labeling." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:201	We argue that by interpreting opinions using econometrics, we have the first objective, quantifiable, and contextsensitive evaluation of opinions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:201	We make the discussion concrete by presenting results on the reputation system of Amazon.com." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:201	We show that user feedback affects the pricing power of merchants and by measuring their pricing power we can infer the polarity and strength of the underlying feedback postings." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:201	1 Introduction A significant number of websites today allow users to post articles where they express opinions about products, firms, people, and so on." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:201	For example, users on Amazom.com post reviews about products they bought and users on eBay.com post feedback describing their experiences with sellers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:201	The goal of opinion mining systems is to identify such pieces of the text that express opinions (Breck et al. , 2007; Konig and Brill, 2006) and then measure the polarity and strength of the expressed opinions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:201	While intuitively the task seems straightforward, there are multiple challenges involved." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:201	 What makes an opinion positive or negative?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:201	Is there an objective measure for this task?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:201	 How can we rank opinions according to their strength?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:201	Can we define an objective measure for ranking opinions?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:201	 How does the context change the polarity and strength of an opinion and how can we take the context into consideration?" ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="19:201	To evaluate the polarity and strength of opinions, most of the existing approaches rely either on training from human-annotated data (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), or use linguistic resources (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004) like WordNet, or rely on co-occurrence statistics (Turney, 2002) between words that are unambiguously positive (e.g. , excellent) and unambiguously negative (e.g. , horrible)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:201	Finally, other approaches rely on reviews with numeric ratings from websites (Pang and Lee, 2002; Dave et al. , 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Cui et al. , 2006) and train (semi-)supervised learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive or negative, or in more fine-grained scales (Pang and Lee, 2005; Wilson et al. , 2006)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:201	Implicitly, the supervised learning techniques assume that numeric ratings fully encapsulate the sentiment of the review.416 In this paper, we take a different approach and instead consider the economic context in which an opinion is evaluated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:201	We observe that the text in on-line systems influence the behavior of the readers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:201	This effect can be measured by observing some easy-tomeasure economic variable, such as product prices." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:201	For instance, online merchants on eBay with positive feedback can sell products for higher prices than competitors with negative evaluations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:201	Therefore, each of these (positive or negative) evaluations has a (positive or negative) effect on the prices that the merchant can charge." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:201	For example, everything else being equal, a seller with speedy delivery may be able to charge $10 more than a seller with slow delivery." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:201	Using this information, we can conclude that speedy is better than slow when applied to delivery and their difference is $10." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:201	Thus, we can infer the semantic orientation and the strength of an evaluation from the changes in the observed economic variable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:201	Following this idea, we use techniques from econometrics to identify the economic value of text and assign a dollar value to each text snippet, measuring sentiment strength and polarity effectively and without the need for labeling or any other resource." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:201	We argue that by interpreting opinions within an econometric framework, we have the first objective and context-sensitive evaluation of opinions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:201	For example, consider the comment good packaging, posted by a buyer to evaluate a merchant." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:201	This comment would have been considered unambiguously positive by the existing opinion mining systems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:201	We observed, though, that within electronic markets, such as eBay, a posting that contains the words good packaging has actually negative effect on the power of a merchant to charge higher prices." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:201	This surprising effect reflects the nature of the comments in online marketplaces: buyers tend to use superlatives and highly enthusiastic language to praise a good merchant, and a lukewarm good packaging is interpreted as negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:201	By introducing the econometric interpretation of opinions we can effortlessly capture such challenging scenarios, something that is impossible to achieve with the existing approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:201	We focus our paper on reputation systems in electronic markets and we examine the effect of opinions on the pricing power of merchants in the marketplace of Amazon.com." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:201	(We discuss more applications in Section 7)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:201	We demonstrate the value of our technique using a dataset with 9,500 transactions that took place over 180 days." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:201	We show that textual feedback affects the power of merchants to charge higher prices than the competition, for the same product, and still make a sale." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:201	We then reverse the logic and determine the contribution of each comment in the pricing power of a merchant." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:201	Thus, we discover the polarity and strength of each evaluation without the need for human annotation or any other form of linguistic resource." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:201	The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="44:201	Section 3 describes our methodology for constructing the data set that we use in our experiments." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:201	Section 4 shows how we combine established techniques from econometrics with text mining techniques to identify the strength and polarity of the posted feedback evaluations." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="47:201	Finally, Section 6 discusses related work and Section 7 discusses further applications and concludes the paper." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:201	2 Reputation Systems and Price Premiums When buyers purchase products in an electronic market, they assess and pay not only for the product they wish to purchase but for a set of fulfillment characteristics as well, e.g., packaging, delivery, and the extent to which the product description matches the actual product." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:201	Electronic markets rely on reputation systems to ensure the quality of these characteristics for each merchant, and the importance of such systems is widely recognized in the literature (Resnick et al. , 2000; Dellarocas, 2003)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:201	Typically, merchants reputation in electronic markets is encoded by a reputation profile that includes: (a) the number of past transactions for the merchant, (b) a summary of numeric ratings from buyers who have completed transactions with the seller, and (c) a chronological list of textual feedback provided by these buyers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:201	Studies of online reputation, thus far, base a merchants reputation on the numeric rating that characterizes the seller (e.g. , average number of stars and number of completed transactions) (Melnik and Alm, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:201	The general conclusion of these studies show that merchants with higher (numeric) reputation can charge higher prices than the competition, for the same products, and still manage to make a sale." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:201	a50 Different sellers in these markets derive their reputation from different characteristics: some sellers have a reputation for fast delivery, while some others have a reputation of having the lowest price among their peers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:201	Similarly, while some sellers are praised for their packaging in the feedback, others get good comments for selling high-quality goods but are criticized for being rather slow with shipping." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:201	Even though previous studies have established the positive correlation between higher (numeric) reputation and higher price premiums, they ignored completely the role of the textual feedback and, in turn, the multi-dimensional nature of reputation in electronic markets." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:193	Specifically, through experiments with cross-lingual projection of subjectivity, we seek answers to the following questions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:193	First, can we derive a subjectivity lexicon for a new language using an existing English subjectivity lexicon and a bilingual dictionary?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:193	Second, can we derive subjectivity-annotated corpora in a new language using existing subjectivity analysis tools for English and a parallel corpus?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:193	Finally, third, can we build tools for subjectivity analysis for a new target language by relying on these automatically generated resources?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:193	We focus our experiments on Romanian, selected as a representative of the large number of languages that have only limited text processing resources developed to date." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:193	Note that, although we work with Romanian, the methods described are applicable to any other language, as in these experiments we (purposely) do not use any language-specific knowledge of the target language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:193	Given a bridge between English and the selected target language (e.g. , a bilingual dictionary or a parallel corpus), the methods can be applied to other languages as well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:193	After providing motivations, we present two approaches to developing sentence-level subjectivity classifiers for a new target language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:193	The first uses a subjectivity lexicon translated from an English one." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:193	The second uses an English subjectivity classifier and a parallel corpus to create target-language training data for developing a statistical classifier." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="17:193	2 Motivation Automatic subjectivity analysis methods have been used in a wide variety of text processing applications, such as tracking sentiment timelines in online forums and news (Lloyd et al. , 2005; Balog et al. , 2006), review classification (Turney, 2002; Pang et al. , 2002), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al. , 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:193	976 While much recent work in subjectivity analysis focuses on sentiment (a type of subjectivity, namely positive and negative emotions, evaluations, and judgments), we opt to focus on recognizing subjectivity in general, for two reasons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:193	First, even when sentiment is the desired focus, researchers in sentiment analysis have shown that a two-stage approach is often beneficial, in which subjective instances are distinguished from objective ones, and then the subjective instances are further classified according to polarity (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al. , 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:193	In fact, the problem of distinguishing subjective versus objective instances has often proved to be more difficult than subsequent polarity classification, so improvements in subjectivity classification promise to positively impact sentiment classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:193	This is reported in studies of manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al. , 2006), recognizing contextual polarity of expressions (Wilson et al. , 2005), and sentiment tagging of words and word senses (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:193	Second, an NLP application may seek a wide range of types of subjectivity attributed to a person, such as their motivations, thoughts, and speculations, in addition to their positive and negative sentiments." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:193	For instance, the opinion tracking system Lydia (Lloyd et al. , 2005) gives separate ratings for subjectivity and sentiment." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="184:193	First, we carried out annotation studies measuring the extent to which subjectivity is preserved across languages in each of the two resources." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="185:193	These studies show that only a relatively small fraction of the entries in the lexicon preserve their subjectivity in the translation, mainly due to the ambiguity in both the source and the target languages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="186:193	This is consistent with observations made in previous work that subjectivity is a property associated not with words, but with word meanings (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="187:193	In contrast, the sentence-level subjectivity was found to be more reliably preserved across languages, with cross-lingual inter-annotator agreements comparable to the monolingual ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="188:193	Second, we validated the two automatically generated subjectivity resources by using them to build a tool for subjectivity analysis in the target language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="189:193	Specifically, we developed two classifiers: a rulebased classifier that relies on the subjectivity lexicon described in Section 3.1, and a machine learning classifier trained on the subjectivity-annotated corpus described in Section 4.1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="190:193	While the highest precision for the subjective classification is obtained with the rule-based classifier, the overall best result of 67.85 F-measure is due to the machine learning approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="191:193	This result is consistent with the annotation studies, showing that the corpus projections preserve subjectivity more reliably than the lexicon translations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="192:193	Finally, neither one of the classifiers relies on language-specific information, but rather on knowledge obtained through projections from English." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:173	Sentence and phrase level sentiment analysis involves a systematic examination of texts, such as blogs, reviews and news reports, for positive, negative or neutral emotions (Wilson et al. , 2005; Grefenstette et al. , 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:173	The term sentiment analysis is used rather differently in financial economics where it refers to the derivation of market confidence indicators from proxies such as stock prices and trading volumes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:173	There is a tradition going back to the Nobel SverigesRiksbank Laureates Herbert Simon (1978 Prize) and Daniel Kahneman (2002 Prize), that shows that investors and traders in such markets can behave irrationally and that this bounded rationality is inspired by what the traders and investors hear from others about the conditions that may or may not prevail in the markets." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:173	Robert Engle (2003 Prize) has given a mathematical description of the asymmetric and affective impact of news on prices: positive news is typically related to large changes in prices but only for a short time; conversely the effect of negative news on prices and volumes of trading is longer lasting." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="40:173	Others, such as Turney (2002), Pang and Vaithyanathan (2002), have examined the positive or negative polarity, rather than presence or absence, of affective content in text." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:173	Our approach to polarity measurement, like others, relies on a lexicon of tagged positive and negative sentiment terms which are used to quantify positive/negative sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:173	In this first iteration of the work, SentiWN (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) was used as it provides a readily interpretable positive and negative polarity value for a set of affective terms which conflates Osgoods (1957) evaluative and activation dimensions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:173	Furthermore, it is based on WordNet 2.0 and can therefore be integrated into the existing text representation algorithm, where some nodes in the cohesion graph carry a SentiWN sentiment value and others do not." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="75:173	The intuition behind this measure is that highly specific nodes or concepts may carry more informational and, by extension, affective content than less specific ones." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="77:173	The specificity measure aims to factor out population sparseness or density in WordNet by evaluating the contribution of each node relative to its depth in the hierarchy, its connectivity (branchingFactor) and its siblings: Spc = (depth+ln(siblings)ln(branchingFactor))NormalizingFactor (1) The three metrics are further specialised according to the following two boolean flags: InText: the metric is calculated based on 1) only those nodes representing terms in the source text, or 2) all nodes in the graph representation derived from the text." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:134	We assume that the task of retrieval of opinionated texts (OIR) can be regarded as a subtask of general IR, but with some distinct features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:134	The experiments showed that the best results were obtained from the combination of character-based processing, dictionary look up (maximum matching) and a negation check." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:134	1 Introduction The extraction of opinionated information has recently become an important research topic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:134	Business and governmental institutions often need to have information about how their products or actions are perceived by people." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:134	Individuals may be interested in other peoples opinions on various topics ranging from political events to consumer products." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:134	At the same time globalization has made the whole world smaller, and a notion of the world as a global village does not surprise people nowadays." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:134	In this context we assume information in Chinese to be of particular interest as the Chinese world (the mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and numerous Chinese communities all over the world) is getting more and more influential over the world economy and politics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:134	We therefore believe that a system capable of providing access to opinionated information in other languages (especially in Chinese) might be of great use for individuals as well as for institutions involved in international trade or international relations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:134	The sentiment classification experiments presented in this paper were done in the context of Opinionated Information Retrieval which is planned to be a module in a Cross-Language Opinion Extraction system (CLOE)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:134	The main goal of this system is to provide access to opinionated information on any topic ad-hoc in a language different to the language of a query." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:134	To implement the idea the CLOE system which is the context for the experiments described in the paper will consist of four main modules: 1." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="18:134	An example of such a query is: Asus laptop + OPINIONS, another, more detailed query, might be Asus laptop + POSITIVE OPINIONS." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:134	Another possible approach to the architecture of the CLOE system would be to implement the processing as a pipeline consisting, first, of using IR to retrieve certain articles relevant to the topic followed by second stage of classifying them according to sentiment polarity." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="24:134	In this study we use a mixed approached, based both on words (tokens consisting of more than one character) and characters as basic units." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:134	It is also important to note, that we use notion of words in the sense of Vocabulary Word as it was stated by Li (2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:134	This means that we use only tokens that are listed in a dictionary, and do not look for all words (including grammar words)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:134	3 Related Work Processing of subjective texts and opinions has received a lot of interest recently." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="28:134	Most of the authors traditionally use a classification-based approach for sentiment extraction and sentiment polarity detection (for example, Pang et al.(2002), Turney (2002), Kim and Hovy (2004) and others), however, the research described in this paper uses the information retrieval (IR) paradigm which has also been used by some researchers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:134	Several sentiment information retrieval models were proposed in the framework of probabilistic language models by Eguchi and Lavrenko (2006)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:134	The setting for the study was a situation when a users query specifies not only terms expressing a certain topic and also specifies a sentiment polarity of interest in some manner, which makes this research very similar to the present one." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:134	However, we use sentiment scores (not probabilistic language models) for sentiment retrieval (see Section 4.1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:134	Dave et al.(Dave et al. , 2003) described a tool for sifting through and synthesizing product reviews, automating the sort of work done by aggregation sites or clipping services." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="45:134	As stated earlier (see Section 1), we assume that the task of retrieval of opinionated texts (OIR) can be regarded as a subtask of general IR with a query consisting of two parts: (1) words indicating topic and (2) a semantic class indicating sentiment (OPINIONS)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="48:134	But whatever level of categorisation we use, the query is still too abstract and cannot be used in practice." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:134	It therefore needs to be put into words and most probably expanded." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:134	The texts should also be indexed with appropriate sentiment tags which in the context of sentiment processing implies classification of the texts according to presence / absence of a sentiment and, if the texts are opinionated, according to their sentiment polarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:134	To test the proposed approach we designed two experiments." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="57:134	As training corpus for the second experiment we use the NTU sentiment dictionary (NTUSD) (by Ku et al.(2006a))3 as well as a list of sentiment scores of Chinese characters obtained from processing of the same dictionary." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="61:134	The same dictionary was also used as a corpus for calculating the sentiment scores of Chinese characters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:134	The use of the dictionary as a training corpus for obtaining the sentiment scores of characters is justified by two reasons: 1) it is domain-independent and 2) it contains only relevant (sentiment-related) information." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:72	An example of a test headline can be: DISCOVERED BOYS BRING SHOCK, JOY 2 Working without a lexicon Our approach takes as its starting point the observation that lexical resources always are noisy, out of date, and most often suffer simultaneously from being both too specific and too general." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:72	For our experiments, our only lexical resource consists of a list of eight positive words and eight negative words, as shown below in Table 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:72	We use a medium-sized corpus of general newsprint to build a general word space, and use our minimal lexical resource to orient ourselves in it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:72	3 Word space A word space is a high-dimensional vector space built from distributional statistics (Schutze, 1993; Sahlgren, 2006), in which each word in the vocabulary is represented as a context vector a0a1 of occurrence frequencies: a0a1a3a2a5a4a7a6a9a8a11a10a13a12a11a14a11a14a11a14a15a12a16a8a18a17a20a19 where a8 is the frequency of word a21 in some context a22." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:72	The point of this representation is that semantic similarity between words can be computed using vector similarity measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:72	Thus, the similarity in meaning between the words a23a25a24 and a23a27a26 can be quantified by computing the similarity between their respective context vectors: sima28a29a23a30a24 a12 a23a27a26a32a31a34a33 sima28 a0 a1 a24 a12 a0 a1 a26a32a31 . The semantics of such a word space are determined by the data from which the occurrence information has been collected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:72	Since the data set in the SemEval Affective Text task consists of news headlines, a relevant word space should be produced from topically and stylistically similar texts, such as newswire documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:72	For this reason, we trained our model on a corpus of English-language newsprint which is available for experimentation for participants in the Cross Language Evaluation Fo296 rum (CLEF).1 The corpus consists of some 100 000 newswire documents from Los Angeles Times for the year 1994." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:72	We presume any similarly sized collection of newsprint would produce similar results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:72	We lemmatized the data using tools from Connexor,2 and removed stop words, leaving some 28 million words with a vocabulary of approximately 300 000 words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:72	Since the data for the affective task only consisted of news headlines, we treated each headline in the LA times corpus as a separate document, thus doubling the number of documents in the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:72	For harvesting occurrence information, we used documents as contexts and standard tfidf-weighting of frequencies, resulting in a 220 220-dimensional word space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:72	No dimensionality reduction was used." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="23:72	The size of the seed set was determined by a number of initial experiments on the development data, where we varied the size of the seed sets from these 8 words to some 700 words in each set (using the WordNet Affect hierarchy (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004))." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="24:72	As comparison, Turney and Littman (2003) used seed sets consisting of 7 words in their word valence annotation experiments, while Turney (2002) used minimal seed sets consisting of only one positive and one negative word (excellent and poor) in his experiments on review classification." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="27:72	The seed words were used to postulate one positive and one negative point (i.e. vector) in the word space by simply taking the centroid of the seed word points: a0a1a1a0 a4a3a2 a0a1a5a4a7a6a8a0 where a9 is one of the seed sets, and a23 is a word in this set." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="29:72	5 Syntagmatic vs paradigmatic relations Our hypothesis is that words carrying most of the valence in news headlines in the experimental test set are syntagmatically rather than paradigmatically related to the kind of very general words used in our seed set.3 As an example, consider test headline 501: TWO HUSSEIN ALLIES ARE HANGED, IRAQI OFFICIAL SAYS." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:72	It seems reasonable to believe that this headline should be annotated with a negative valence, and that the desicive word in this case is hanged. Obviously, hanged has no paradigmatic neighbors (e.g. synonyms, antonyms or other nyms) among the seed words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:72	However, it is likely that hanged will co-occur with (and therefore have a syntagmatic relation to) general negative terms such as dangerous and maybe war. In fact, in this example headline, the most negatively associated words are probably Hussein and Iraqi, which often co-occur with general negative terms such as war and dangerous in newswire text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:72	To produce a word space that contains predominantely syntagmatic relations, we built the distributional relations using entire documents as contexts (i.e. each dimension in the word space corresponds to a document in the data)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:72	If we would have used words as contexts instead, we would have ended up with a paradigmatic word space.4 3Syntagmatic relations hold between co-occurring words, while paradigmatic relations hold between words that do not co-occur, but that occur with the same other words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:72	4See Sahlgren (2006) for an explanation of how the choice of contexts determines the semantic content of the word space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:72	297 6 Compositionality and semantic relations The relations between words in headlines were modeled using the most simple operation conceivable: we simply add all words context vectors to a compound headline vector and use that as the representation of the headline: a0a1a1a0 a4 a2 a0a1a8a4 a6a2a0 where a3 is a test headline, and a23 is a word in this headline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:72	This is obviously a daring, if not foolhardy, approach to modelling syntactic structure, compositional semantics, and all types of intra-sentential semantic dependencies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:72	It can fairly be expected to be improved upon through an appropriate finer-grained analysis of word presence, adjacency and syntactic relationships." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:72	However, this approach is similar to that taken by most search engines in use today, is a useful first baseline, and as can be seen from our results below, does deliver acceptable results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:72	7 Valence annotation To perform the valence annotation, we first lemmatized the headlines and removed stop words and words with frequency above 10 000 in the LA times corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:72	For each headline, we then summed  as discussed above  the context vectors of the remaining words, thus producing a 220 220dimensional vector for each headline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:72	This vector was then compared to each of the postulated valence vectors by computing the cosine of the angles between the vectors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:72	We thus have for each headline two cosines, one between the headline and the positive vector and one between the headline and the negative vector." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:72	The valence vector with highest cosine score (and thus the smallest spatial angle) was chosen to annotate the headline." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:72	For the negative valence vector we assigned a negative valence value, and for the positive vector a positive value." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:72	In 11 cases, a value of a4a6a5a8a7a9a5 was ascribed, either because all headline words were removed by frequency and stop word filtering, or because none of the remaining words occurred in our newsprint corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:72	Our method thus only delivers a binary valence decision  either positive or negative valence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:72	Granted, we could have assigned a neutral valence to very low cosine scores, but as any threshold for deciding on a neutral score would be completely arbitrary, we decided to only give fully positive or negative scores to the test headlines." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:72	Also, since our aim was to provide a high-recall result, we did not wish to leave any headline with an equivocal score." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:72	We scaled the scores to fit the requirements of the coarse-grained evaluation: for each headline with a non-zero score, we multiplied the value with a10a11a5a2a5 and boosted each value with a12a13a5 .5 By this scaling operation we guaranteed a positive or a negative score for each headline (apart from the 11 exceptions, in effect unanalyzed by our algorithm, as mentioned above)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="69:72	This is in keeping with our overall approach, which aims for as little pre-computed resources as possible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:72	At almost every juncture in our processing we made risky and simplistic assumptions  using simple frequencies of word occurrence as a semantic model; using a small seed set of positive and negative terms as a target; postulating one semantic locus each for positive and negative emotion; modelling syntactic and semantic relations between terms by vector addition  and yet we find that the semantic structure of distributional statistics yields a signal good enough for distinguishing positive from negative headlines with a non-random accuracy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:72	Despite its simplicity, out method produces very good recall (60.17) in the coarse-grained evaluation (the median recall for all systems is 29.59)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="14:86	In order to be able to conduct such multi-category analysis, we believe that first we need a comprehensive theory of what a human emotion is, and then we need to understand how the emotion is expressed and transmitted within the natural language." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:86	However, some of the major drawbacks in this field are related to the manual or automatic acquisition of subjective expressions, as well as to the lack of resources in terms of coverage." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="22:86	2 Related work Our approach for emotion classification is based on the idea of (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and is similar to those of (Turney, 2002) and (Turney and Littman, 2003)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="28:86	The co-occurrences of these words are searched on the web, and then the Mutual Information score for the two groups of adjectives is measured." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:86	When the adjective of the review appear more often with ?excellent??" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:86	then the review is classified as positive, and when the adjectives appear more often with ?poor??" ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="32:86	Following Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) and Turney (2002), we decided to observe how often the words from the headline co-occur with each one of the six emotions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="34:86	while ?war??appears more often with ?fear??" ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="35:86	Some of the differences between our approach and those of Turney (2002) are mentioned below: ??objectives: Turney (2002) aims at binary text classification, while our objective is six class classification of one-liner headlines." ></td>
	<td class="line o" title="36:86	Moreover, we have to provide a score between 0 and 100 indicating the presence of an emotion, and not simply to identify what the emotion in the text is.

	<td class="line oc" title="37:86	??word class: Turney (2002) measures polarity using only adjectives, however in our approach we consider the noun, the verb, the adverb and the adjective content words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:86	The motivation of our study comes from (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006), according to which each content word can express sentiment and emotion." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="43:86	??queries: The queries of Turney (2002) are made up of a pair of adjectives, and in our approach the query contains the content words of the headline and an emotion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:86	There are other emotion classification approaches that use the web as a source of information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:86	For instance, (Taboada et al. , 2006) extracted from the web co-occurrences of adverbs, adjectives, nouns and verbs." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:86	Kim and Hovy (2006) integrated verb information from FrameNet and incorporated it into semantic role labeling." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:86	3 Web co-occurrences In order to determine the emotions of a headline, we measure the Pointwise Mutual Information (MI) of ei and cwj as MI(ei,cwj) = log2 hits(ei,cwj)hits(ei)hits(cwj), where ei ??" ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="71:86	An interesting conclusion deduced from the trail and test emotion data is that the system detects better the negative feelings such as anger, disgust, fear and sadness, in comparison to the positive emotions such as joy and surprise." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="79:86	4http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/ 336 So far we did not consider the impact of valence shifter (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006) and we were unable to detect that a negative adverb or adjective transforms the emotion from positive into negative and vice versa." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:86	We are also interested in studying how to conduct queries not as a bag of words but bind by syntactic relations (Wilson et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:86	6 Conclusion Emotion classification is a challenging and difficult task in Natural Language Processing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:86	For our first attempt to detect the amount of angry, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust and joy emotions, we have presented a simple web co-occurrence approach." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="84:86	According to the yielded results, the presented approach can determine whether one sentiment is predominant or not, and most of the correct sentiment assignments correspond to the negative emotions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:86	However, we need to improve the approach in many aspects and to incorporate more knowledge-rich resources, as well as to tune the 0-100 emotion scale." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:290	Comparisons are related to but are also quite different from direct opinions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:290	For example, a typical direct opinion sentence is the picture quality of Camera X is great, while a typical comparative sentence is the picture quality of Camera X is better than that of Camera Y. We can see that comparisons use different language constructs from direct opinions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:290	A comparison typically expresses a comparative opinion on two or more entities with regard to their shared features or attributes, e.g., picture quality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:290	Although direct opinions are most common in UGC, comparisons are also widely used (about 10% of the sentences), especially in forum discussions where users often ask questions such as X vs. Y (X and Y are competing products)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:290	Discussions are then centered on comparisons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:290	Jindal and Liu (2006) proposed a technique to identify comparative sentences from reviews and forum posts, and to extract entities, comparative words, and entity features that are being compared." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:290	For example, in the sentence, Camera X has longer battery life than Camera Y, the technique extracts Camera X and Camera Y as entities, and longer as the comparative word and battery life as the attribute of the cameras being compared." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:290	However, the technique does not find which entity is preferred by the author." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:290	For this example, clearly Camera Y is the preferred camera with respect to the battery life of the cameras." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:290	This paper aims to solve this problem, which is useful in many applications because the preferred entity is the key piece of information in a comparative opinion." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="27:290	In this work, we treat a sentence as the basic 241 information unit." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:290	Our objective is thus to identify the preferred entity in each comparative sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:290	A useful observation about comparative sentences is that in each such sentence there is usually a comparative word (e.g., better, worse and er word) or a superlative word (e.g., best, worst and est word)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:290	The entities being compared often appear on the two sides of the comparative word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:290	A superlative sentence may only have one entity, e.g., Camera X is the best." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:290	For simplicity, we use comparative words (sentences) to mean both comparative words (sentences) and superlative words (sentences)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:290	Clearly, the preferred entity in a comparative sentence is mainly determined by the comparative word in the sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:290	Some comparative words explicitly indicate user preferences, e.g., better, worse, and best." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:290	We call such words opinionated comparative words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:290	For example, in the sentence, the picture quality of Camera X is better than that of Camera Y, Camera X is preferred due to the opinionated comparative word better." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:290	However, many comparative words are not opinionated, or their opinion orientations (i.e., positive or negative) depend on the context and/or the application domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:290	For instance, the word longer is not opinionated as it is normally used to express that the length of some feature of an entity is greater than the length of the same feature of another entity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:290	However, in a particular context, it can express a desired (or positive) or undesired (or negative) state." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:290	For example, in the sentence, the battery life of Camera X is longer than Camera Y, longer clearly expresses a desired state for battery life (although this is an objective sentence with no explicit opinion)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:290	Camera X is thus preferred with regard to battery life of the cameras." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:290	The opinion in this sentence is called an implicit opinion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:290	We also say that longer is positive in this context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:290	We know this because of our existing domain knowledge." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:290	However, longer may also be used to express an undesirable state in a different context, e.g., Program Xs execution time is longer than Program Y." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:290	longer is clearly negative here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:290	Program Y is thus preferred." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:290	We call comparative words such as longer and smaller context-dependent opinion comparatives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:290	Sentences with opinionated words (e.g., better, and worse) are usually easy to handle." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:290	Then the key to solve our problem is to identify the opinion orientations (positive or negative) of context-dependent comparative words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:290	To this end, two questions need to be answered: (1) what is a context and (2) how to use the context to help determine the opinion orientation of a comparative word?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:290	The simple answer to question (1) is the whole sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:290	However, a whole sentence as context is too complex because it may contain too much irrelevant information, which can confuse the system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:290	Intuitively, we want to use the smallest context that can determine the orientation of the comparative word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:290	Obviously, the comparative word itself must be involved." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:290	We thus conjecture that the context should consist of the entity feature being compared and the comparative word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:290	Our experimental results show that this context definition works quite well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:290	To answer the second question, we need external information or knowledge because there is no way that a computer program can solve the problem by analyzing the sentence itself." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:290	In this paper, we propose to use the external information in customer reviews on the Web to help solve the problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:290	There are a large number of such reviews on almost any product or service." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:290	These reviews can be readily downloaded from many sites." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:290	In our work, we use reviews from epinions.com." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:290	Each review in epinions.com has separate Pros and Cons (which is also the case in most other review sites)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:290	Thus, positive and negative opinions are known as they are separated by reviewers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:290	However, they cannot be used directly because Pros and Cons seldom contain comparative words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:290	We need to deal with this problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:290	Essentially, the proposed method computes whether the comparative word and the feature are more associated in Pros or in Cons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:290	If they are more associated in Pros (or Cons) than Cons (or Pros), then the comparative word is likely to be positive (or negative) for the feature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:290	A new association measure is also proposed to suit our purpose." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:290	Our experiment results show that it can achieve high precision and recall." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="82:290	Our method is different in three aspects." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:290	First, we argue that finding domain opinion words is problematic because in the same domain the same word may indicate different opinions depending on what features it is applied to." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:290	For example, in the camera domain, long is positive in the battery life is very long but negative in it takes a long time to focus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="59:219	For this specialized text genre, it has been sufficient to limit the notion of topic to mentions of product names and components and their attributes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:219	Thus, topic extraction has been effectively substituted with a lexicon look-up and techniques have focused on how to learn or acquire an appropriate lexicon for the task." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="62:219	Further, there are analyses (Wiebe et al., 2005) and experiments (Wilson et al., 2005) that indicate that lexicon-lookup approaches to subjectivity analysis will have limited success on general texts." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="64:219	The MPQA corpus, for example, was originally intended to include topic annotations, but the task was abandoned after confirming that it was very difficult (Wiebe, 2005; Wilson, 2005), although target span annotation is currently underway." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:219	Whileuseful,targetspansalonewillbeinsufficient for many applications: they neither contain information indicating which opinions are about the same topic, nor provide a concise textual representation of the topics." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="70:219	In other words, Kim and Hovy extract what we refer to as the target spans, and do so for a subset of the opinion-bearing words in the text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:219	Although on many occasions target spans coincide with opinion topics (as in Example 1), we have observed that on many other occasions this is not the case (as in Example 2)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:219	Furthermore, hampered by the lack of resources with manually annotated targets, Kim and Hovy could provide only a limited evaluation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:219	As we have defined it, opinion topic identification bears some resemblance to topic segmentation, the goal of which is to partition a text into a linear sequence of topically coherent segments." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:219	Existing methods for topic segmentation typically assume that fragments of text (e.g. sentences or sequences of words of a fixed length) with similar lexical distribution are about the same topic; the goal of these methods is to find the boundaries where the lexical distribution changes (e.g. Choi (2000), Malioutov and Barzilay (2006))." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="78:219	This work,however, considersnamedentitiesandheads of proper noun phrases rather than topic spans, and the relations learned are those commonly held between NPs (e.g. senator-of-state, city-of-state, chairman-of-organization) rather than a more general coreference relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:219	4 A Coreference Approach to Topic Identification Given our initial definition of opinion topics (Section 2), the next task is to determine which computational approaches might be employed for automatic opinion topic identification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:219	We begin this exercise by considering some of the problematic characteristics of opinion topics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:219	Multiple potential topics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:219	As noted earlier via Example 2, a serious problem in opinion topic identification is the mention of multiple potential topics within the target span of the opinion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:219	Although an issue for all opinions, this problem is typically more pronounced in opinions that do not carry sentiment (as in Example 2)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:219	Our current definition of opinion topic requires the NLP system (or a human annotator) to decide which of the entities described in the target span, if any, refers to the intended topic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:219	This decision can be aided by the following change to our definition of opinion topic, which introduces the idea of a contextdependent information focus: the TOPIC of an opinion is the real-world entity that is the subject of the opinion as intended by the opinion holder based 819 on the discourse context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:219	With this modified definition in hand, and given Example 3 as the succeeding context for Example 2, we argue that the intended subject, and hence the TOPIC, of Als opinion in 2 can be quickly identifiedasthe FUEL TAX, whichisdenotedbythe TOPIC SPANS tax gas in 2 and fuel tax in 3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:219	Opinion topics not always explicitly mentioned." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:219	In stark contrast to the above, on many occasions the topic is not mentioned explicitly at all within the target span, as in the following example: (5)[OH John] identified the violation of Palestinian human rights as one of the main factors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:219	TOPIC: ISRAELIPALESTINIAN CONFLICT We have further observed that the opinion topic is often not mentioned within the same paragraph and, on a few occasions, not even within the same document as the opinion expression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:219	4.1 Our Solution: Topic Coreference With the above examples and problems in mind, we hypothesize that the notion of topic coreference will facilitate both the manual and automatic identification of opinion topics: We say that two opinions are topic-coreferent if they share the same opinion topic." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="30:153	Engstrm (2004) reports decreased accuracy in cross-domain classification since sentiment in different domains is often expressed in different ways." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="32:153	Aue and Gamon (2005) attempt to solve the problem of the absence of large amounts of labeled data by customizing sentiment classifiers to new domains using training data from other domains." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:153	Recently, there has been a shift of interest towards more fine-grained approaches to processing of sentiment, in which opinion is extracted at the sentence level, sometimes including information about different features of a product that are commented on and/or the opinion holder (Hu and Liu, 2004; Ku et al., 2006)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="46:153	Although this can facilitate the use of subsequent computational techniques, there is no a clear definition of what a 'word' is in the modern Chinese language, so the use of such segmenters is of dubious theoretical status; indeed, good results have been reported from systems which do not assume such pre-processing (Foo and Li, 2004; Xu et al., 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:153	2.4 Seed Word Selection We are not aware of any sentiment analysis system that uses unsupervised seed word selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:153	However, Pang et al.(2002) showed that it is difficult to get good coverage of a target domain from manually selected words, and even simple corpus frequency counts may produce a better list of features for supervised classification: human-created lists resulted in 64% accuracy on a movie review corpus, while a list of frequent words scored 69%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:153	Pang et al. also observed that some words without any significant emotional orientation were quite good features: for example, the word still turned out to be a good indicator of positive reviews as it was often used in sentences such as Still, though, it was worth seeing''." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="54:153	The approach does not use a word segmentation module; in this paper we use the term 'lexical item' to denote any sequence of Chinese characters that is treated by the system as a unit, whatever it is linguistically  a morpheme, a word or a phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:153	1074 Our initial aim was to investigate ways of improving the classifier by automatically finding a better seed, because Zagibalov & Carroll indicate that in different domains they could, by manual trial and error, find a seed other than  (good) which produced better results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:153	To find such a seed automatically, we make two assumptions: 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:153	Attitude is often expressed through the negation of vocabulary items with the opposite meaning; for example in Chinese it is more common to say not good than bad (Tan, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:153	Zagibalov & Carroll's system uses this observation to find negative lexical items while nevertheless starting only from a positive seed." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="61:153	The polarity of a candidate seed needs to be determined." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:153	To do this we assume we can use the lexical item   (good) as a gold standard for positive lexical items and compare the pattern of contexts a candidate seed occurs in to the pattern exhibited by the gold standard." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:153	Looking at product review corpora, we observed that good is always more often used without negation in positive texts, while in negative texts it is more often used with negation (e.g. not good)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:153	Also, good occurs more often in positive texts than negative, and more frequently without negation than with it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:153	We use the latter observation as the basis for identifying seed lexical items, finding those which occur with negation but more frequently occur without it." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:153	As well as detecting negation1 we also use adverbials2 to avoid hypothesizing non-contentful seeds: the characters following the sequence of a negation and an adverbial are in general contentful units, as opposed to parts of words, function words, etc. In what follows we refer to such constructions as negated adverbial constructions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="72:190	However, Pang & Lee (2005) describe an approach closer to ours in which they determine an author's evaluation with respect to a multi-point scale, similar to the 'five-star' sentiment scale widely used on review sites." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="75:190	The main differences are that Pang and Lee use discrete classes (although more than two), not a continuum as in our approach, and use supervisedmachine learningrather than unsupervised techniques." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:190	A similar approach was adopted by Hagedorn et al.(2007), applied to news stories: they defined five classes encoding sentiment intensity and trained their classifier on a manually tagged training corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="79:190	There has also been previous work on determining whether a given text is factual or expresses opinion (Yu& Hatzivassiloglu, 2003; Pang & Lee, 2004); again this work uses a binary distinction, and supervised rather than unsupervised approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:190	Recent work on classification of terms with respect to opinion (Esuli & Sebastiani, 2006) uses a three-category system to characterize the opinionrelated properties of word meanings, assigning numerical scores to Positive, Negative and Objective categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:190	The visualization of these scores somewhat resembles our graphs in Section 5, although we use two orthogonal scales rather than three categories; we are also concerned with classification ofdocumentsratherthanterms." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="83:190	As we do not use multiple classifiers our approach is quite far from cotraining." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="84:190	But it is close to the paradigm described by Yarowsky (1995) and Turney (2002) as it also employs self-training based on a relatively small seed data set which is incrementally enlarged with unlabelled samples." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="87:190	Wealso use the smallest possible seed vocabulary, containing just a single word; however there are no restrictions regarding the maximum number of items in the seed vocabulary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:190	3 Data 3.1 Seed Vocabulary Our approach starts out with a seed vocabulary consisting of a single word, z (good)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:190	This word is tagged as a positive vocabulary item; initially there are no negative items." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:190	The choice of word was arbitrary, and other words with strongly positive or negative meaning would also be plausible seeds." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:190	Indeed, z might not be the best possible seed, as it is relatively ambiguous: in some contexts it means to like or acts as the adverbial very, and is often used as part of other words (although usually contributing a positive meaning)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:190	But since it is one of the most frequent units in the Chinese language, it is likely to occur in a relatively large number of reviews, which is important for the rapidgrowthofthevocabularylist." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:190	3.2 TestCorpus Our test corpus is derived from product reviews harvested from the website IT1681." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:190	All the reviews were tagged by their authors as either positive or negative overall." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:190	Most reviews consist of two or three distinct parts: positive opinions, negative opinions, and comments ('other')  although some 1http://product.it168.com 306 reviews have only one part." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="4:177	1 Introduction One of the emerging directions in NLP is the development of machine learning methods that perform well not only on the domain on which they were trained, but also on other domains, for which training data is not available or is not sufficient to ensure adequate machine learning." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:177	Recent experiments assessing system portability across different domains, conducted by Aue and Gamon (2005), demonstrated that sentiment annotation classifiers trained in one domain do not perform well on other domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:177	A number of methods has been proposed in order to overcome this system portability limitation by using out-of-domain data, unlabelled in-domain corpora or a combination of in-domain and out-of-domain examples (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Bai et al., 2005; Drezde et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2007)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="14:177	The final, third part of the paper presents our system, composed of an ensemble of two classifiers  one trained on WordNet glosses and synsets and the other trained on a small in-domain training set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:177	290 2 Domain Adaptation in Sentiment Research Most text-level sentiment classifiers use standard machine learning techniques to learn and select features from labeled corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:177	Such approaches work well in situations where large labeled corpora are available for training and validation (e.g., movie reviews), but they do not perform well when training data is scarce or when it comes from a different domain (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Read, 2005), topic (Read, 2005) or time period (Read, 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:177	There are two alternatives to supervised machine learning that can be used to get around this problem: on the one hand, general lists of sentiment clues/features can be acquired from domain-independent sources such as dictionaries or the Internet, on the other hand, unsupervised and weakly-supervised approaches can be used to take advantage of a small number of annotated in-domain examples and/or of unlabelled indomain data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:177	The first approach, using general word lists automatically acquired from the Internet or from dictionaries, outperforms corpus-based classifiers when such classifiers use out-of-domain training data or when the training corpus is not sufficiently large to accumulate the necessary feature frequency information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:177	But such general word lists were shown to perform worse than statistical models built on sufficiently large in-domain training sets of movie reviews (Pang et al., 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:177	On other domains, such as product reviews, the performance of systems that use general word lists is comparable to the performance of supervised machine learning approaches (Gamon and Aue, 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:177	The recognition of major performance deficiencies of supervised machine learning methods with insufficient or out-of-domain training brought about an increased interest in unsupervised and weaklysupervised approaches to feature learning." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="23:177	This system performed well even when compared to systems trained on a large set of in-domain examples: on feedback messages from a web survey on knowledge bases, Aue and Gamon report 73.86% accuracy using unlabelled data compared to 77.34% for in-domain and 72.39% for the best out-of-domain training on a large training set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:177	Drezde et al.(2007) applied structural correspondence learning (Drezde et al., 2007) to the task of domain adaptation for sentiment classification of product reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:177	They showed that, depending on the domain, a small number (e.g., 50) of labeled examples allows to adapt the model learned on another corpus to a new domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:177	However, they note that the success of such adaptation and the number of necessary in-domain examples depends on the similarity between the original domain and the new one." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:177	Similarly, Tan et al.(2007) suggested to combine out-of-domain labeled examples with unlabelled ones from the target domain in order to solve the domain-transfer problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:177	They applied an outof-domain-trained SVM classifier to label examples from the target domain and then retrained the classifier using these new examples." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:177	In order to maximize the utility of the examples from the target domain, these examples were selected using Similarity Ranking and Relative Similarity Ranking algorithms (Tan et al., 2007)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:177	Depending on the similarity between domains, this method brought up to 15% gain compared to the baseline SVM." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:177	Overall, the development of semi-supervised approaches to sentiment tagging is a promising direction of the research in this area but so far, based on reported results, the performance of such methods is inferior to the supervised approaches with indomain training and to the methods that use general word lists." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:177	It also strongly depends on the similarity between the domains as has been shown by (Drezde et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2007)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:177	3 Factors Affecting System Performance The comparison of system performance across different domains involves a number of factors that can significantly affect system performance  from training set size to level of analysis (sentence or entire document), document domain/genre and many other factors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:177	In this section we present a series of experiments conducted to assess the effects of different external factors (i.e., factors unrelated to the merits of the system itself) on system performance in order to establish the baseline for performance comparisons across different domains/genres." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="37:177	291 3.1 Level of Analysis Research on sentiment annotation is usually conducted at the text (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Riloff et al., 2006; Turney, 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003) or at the sentence levels (Gamon and Aue, 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2005; Riloff et al., 2006)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:177	It should be noted that each of these levels presents different challenges for sentiment annotation." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="39:177	For example, it has been observed that texts often contain multiple opinions on different topics (Turney, 2002; Wiebe et al., 2001), which makes assignment of the overall sentiment to the whole document problematic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:177	On the other hand, each individual sentence contains a limited number of sentiment clues, which often negatively affects the accuracy and recall if that single sentiment clue encountered in the sentence was not learned by the system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:177	Since the comparison of sentiment annotation system performance on texts and on sentences has not been attempted to date, we also sought to close this gap in the literature by conducting the first set of our comparative experiments on data sets of 2,002 movie review texts and 10,662 movie review snippets (5331 with positive and 5331 with negative sentiment) provided by Bo Pang (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/pabo/moviereview-data/)." ></td>

Review Sentiment Scoring via a Parse-and-Paraphrase Paradigm

	<td class="line x" title="3:229	Sentiment identification has been well studied; however, most previous work provides binary polarities only (positive and negative), and the polarity of sentiment is simply reversed when a negation is detected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:229	The extraction of lexical features such as unigram/bigram also complicates the sentiment classification task, as linguistic structure such as implicit long-distance dependency is often disregarded." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:229	In this paper, we propose an approach to extracting adverb-adjective-noun phrases based on clause structure obtained by parsing sentences into a hierarchical representation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:229	We also propose a robust general solution for modeling the contribution of adverbials and negation to the score for degree of sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:229	In an application involving extracting aspect-based pros and cons from restaurant reviews, we obtained a 45% relative improvement in recall through the use of parsing methods, while also improving precision." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:229	1 Introduction Online product reviews have provided an extensive collection of free-style texts as well as product ratings prepared by general users, which in return provide grassroots contributions to users interested in a particular product or service as assistance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:229	Yet, valuable as they are, free-style reviews contain much noisy data and are tedious to read through in order to reach an overall conclusion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:229	Thus, we conducted this study to automatically process and evaluate product reviews in order to generate both numerical evaluation and textual summaries of users opinions, with the ultimate goal of adding value to real systems such as a restaurant-guide dialogue system." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="11:229	Sentiment summarization has been well studied in the past decade (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004a, 2004b; Carenini et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:229	The polarity of users sentiments in each segment of review texts is extracted, and the polarities of individual sentiments are aggregated among all the sentences/segments of texts to give a numerical scaling on sentiment orientation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:229	Most of the work done for sentiment analysis so far has employed shallow parsing features such as part-of-speech tagging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:229	Frequent adjectives and nouns/noun phrases are extracted as opinion words and representative product features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:229	However, the linguistic structure of the sentence is usually not taken into consideration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:229	High level linguistic features, if well utilized and accurately extracted, can provide much insight into the semantic meaning of user opinions and contribute to the task of sentiment identification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:229	Furthermore, in addition to adjectives and nouns, adverbials and negation also play an important role in determining the degree of the orientation level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:229	For example, very good and good certainly express different degrees of positive sentiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:229	Also, in previous studies, when negative expressions are identified, the polarity of sentiment in the associated segment of text is simply reversed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:229	However, semantic expressions are quite different from the absolute opposite values in mathematics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:229	For example, not bad does not express the opposite meaning of bad, which would be highly positive." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:229	Simply reversing the polarity of sentiment on the appearance of negations may result in inaccurate interpretation of sentiment expressions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:229	Thus, a system which attempts to quantify sentiment while ignoring adverbials is missing a significant component of the sentiment score, especially if the adverbial is a negative word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:229	161 Another challenging aspect of negation is proper scoping of the negative reference over the right constituent, which we argue, can be handled quite well with careful linguistic analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:229	Take the sentence I dont think the place is very clean as example." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:229	A linguistic approach associating long-distance elements with semantic relations can identify that the negation not scopes over the complement clause, thus extracting not very clean instead of very clean." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:229	Our goal in modeling adverbials is to investigate whether a simple linear correction model can capture the polarity contribution of all adverbials." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:229	Furthermore, is it also appropriate to adjust for multiple adverbs, including negation, via a linear additive model?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:229	I.e., can not very good be modeled as not(very(good))?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:229	The fact that not very good seems to be less negative than not good suggests that such an algorithm might work well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:229	From these derivations we have developed a model which treats negations in the exact same way as modifying adverbs, via an accumulative linear offset model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:229	This yields a very generic and straightforward solution to modeling the strength of sentiment expression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:229	In this paper we utilize a parse-and-paraphrase paradigm to identify semantically related phrases in review texts, taking quantifiers (e.g., modifying adverbs) and qualifiers (e.g., negations) into special consideration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:229	The approach makes use of a lexicalized probabilistic syntactic grammar to identify and extract sets of adverb-adjectivenoun phrases that match review-related patterns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:229	Such patterns are constructed based on wellformed linguistic structure; thus, relevant phrases can be extracted reliably." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:229	We also propose a cumulative linear offset model to calculate the degree of sentiment for joint adjectives and quantifiers/qualifiers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:229	The proposed sentiment prediction model takes modifying adverbs and negations as universal scales on strength of sentiment, and conducts cumulative calculation on the degree of sentiment for the associated adjective." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="10:249	Knowing the meaning (and thus subjectivity) of these words would help a system recognize the negative sentiments in these sentences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:249	Most subjectivity lexicons are compiled as lists of keywords, rather than word meanings (senses)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:249	However, many keywords have both subjective and objective senses." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="15:249	To tackle this source of error, we define a new task, subjectivity word sense disambiguation (SWSD), which is to automatically determine which word instances in a corpus are being used with subjective senses, and which are being used with objective senses." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="22:249	The performance is substantially above both baseline and the performance of full WSD on the same data, suggesting that the task is feasible, and that subjectivity provides a natural coarsegrained grouping of senses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:249	The second part demonstrates the promise of SWSD for contextual subjectivity analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:249	First, we show that subjectivity sense ambiguity is highly prevalent in the MPQA opinion-annotated corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2008), thus establishing the potential benefit of performing SWSD." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:249	Nonetheless, as argued by (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Su and Markert, 2008), there are also motivations for a separate subjective/objective (S/O) classification." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="4:238	Without knowing the users intention, a clustering algorithm will only group documents along the most prominent dimension, which may not be the one the user desires." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:238	To address this problem, we propose a novel way of incorporating user feedback into a clustering algorithm, which allows a user to easily specify the dimension along which she wants the data points to be clustered via inspecting only a small number of words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:238	We demonstrate the viability of our method on several challenging sentiment datasets." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:238	1 Introduction Text clustering is one of the most important applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:238	A common approach to this problem consists of (1) computing the similarity between each pair of documents, each of which is typically represented as a bag of words; and (2) using an unsupervised clustering algorithm to partition the documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:238	The majority of existing work on text clustering has focused on topic-based clustering, where high accuracies can be achieved even for datasets with a large number of classes (e.g., 20 Newsgroups)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:238	On the other hand, there has been relatively little work on sentiment-based clustering and the related task of unsupervised polarity classification, where the goal is to cluster (or classify) a set of documents (e.g., reviews) according to the polarity (e.g., thumbs up or thumbs down) expressed by the author in an unsupervised manner." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:238	Despite the large amount of recent work on sentiment analysis and opinion mining, much of it has focused on supervised methods (e.g., Pang et al.(2002), Kim and Hovy (2004), Mullen and Collier (2004))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:238	One weakness of these existing supervised polarity classification systems is that they are typically domainand language-specific." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:238	Hence, when given a new domain or language, one needs to go through the expensive process of collecting a large amount of annotated data in order to train a high-performance polarity classifier." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:238	Some recent attempts have been made to leverage existing sentiment corpora or lexica to automatically create annotated resources for new domains or languages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:238	However, such methods require the existence of either a parallel corpus/machine translation engine for projecting/translating annotations/lexica from a resource-rich language to the target language (Banea et al., 2008; Wan, 2008), or a domain that is similar enough to the target domain (Blitzer et al., 2007)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:238	When the target domain or language fails to meet this requirement, sentiment-based clustering or unsupervised polarity classification become appealing alternatives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:238	Unfortunately, to our knowledge, these tasks are largely under-investigated in the NLP community." ></td>
	<td class="line pc" title="20:238	Turneys (2002) work is perhaps one of the most notable examples of unsupervised polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line n" title="21:238	However, while his system learns the semantic orientation of the phrases in a review in an unsupervised manner, this information is used to predict the polarity of a review heuristically." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:238	Despite its practical significance, sentimentbased clustering is a challenging task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:238	To illustrate its difficulty, consider the task of clustering a set of movie reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:238	Since each review may contain a description of the plot and the authors 580 sentiment, a clustering algorithm may cluster reviews along either the plot dimension or the sentiment dimension; and without knowing the users intention, they will be clustered along the most prominent dimension." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:238	Assuming the usual bagof-words representation, the most prominent dimension will more likely be plot, as it is not uncommon for a review to be devoted almost exclusively to the plot, with the author briefly expressing her sentiment only at the end of the review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:238	Even if the reviews contain mostly subjective material, the most prominent dimension may still not be sentiment, due to the fact that many reviews are sentimentally ambiguous." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:238	Specifically, a reviewer may have negative opinions on the actors but at the same time talk enthusiastically about how much she enjoyed the plot." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:238	The presence of both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words in these reviews renders the sentiment dimension hidden (i.e., less prominent) as far as clustering is concerned." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:238	Therefore, there is no guarantee that the clustering algorithm will automatically produce a sentiment-based clustering of the reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:238	Hence, it is important for a user to provide feedback on the clustering process to ensure that the reviews are clustered along the sentiment dimension, possibly in an interactive manner." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:238	One way to do this would be to ask the user to annotate a small number of reviews with polarity information, possibly through an active learning procedure to minimize human intervention (Dredze and Crammer, 2008)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:238	Another way would be to have the user explicitly identify the relevant features (in our case, the sentiment-bearing words) at the beginning of the clustering process (Liu et al., 2004), or incrementally construct the set of relevant features in an interactive fashion (Bekkerman et al., 2007; Raghavan and Allan, 2007; Roth and Small, 2009)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:238	In addition, the user may supply constraints on which pairs of documents must or must not appear in the same cluster (Wagstaff et al., 2001), or simply tell the algorithm whether two clusters should be merged or split during the clustering process (Balcan and Blum, 2008)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:238	It is worth noting that many of these feedback mechanisms were developed by machine learning researchers for general clustering tasks and not for sentiment-based clustering." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:238	Our goal in this paper is to propose a novel mechanism allowing a user to cluster a set of documents along the desired dimension, which may be a hidden dimension, with very limited user feedback." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:238	In comparison to the aforementioned feedback mechanisms, ours is arguably much simpler: we only require that the user select a dimension by examining a small number of features for each dimension, as opposed to having the user generate the feature space in an interactive manner or identify clusters that need to be merged or split." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:238	In particular, identifying clusters for merging or splitting in Balcan and Blums algorithm may not be as easy as it appears: for each MERGE or SPLIT decision the user makes, she has to sample a large number of documents from the cluster(s), read through the documents, and base her decision on the extent to which the documents are (dis)similar to each other." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:238	Perhaps more importantly, our human experiments involving five users indicate that all of them can easily identify the sentiment dimension based on the features, thus providing suggestive evidence that our method is viable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:238	In sum, our contributions in this paper are threefold." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:238	First, we propose a novel feedback mechanism for clustering allowing a user to easily specify the dimension along which she wants data points to be clustered and apply the mechanism to the challenging, yet under-investigated problem of sentiment-based clustering." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:238	Second, spectral learning, which is the core of our method, has not been applied extensively to NLP problems, and we hope that our work can increase the awareness of this powerful machine learning technique in the NLP community." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:238	Finally, we demonstrate the viability of our method not only by evaluating its performance on sentiment datasets, but also via a set of human experiments, which is typically absent in papers that involve algorithms for incorporating user feedback." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="46:238	2 Spectral Clustering When given a clustering task, an important question to ask is: which clustering algorithm should we use?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:238	A popular choice is k-means." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:238	Nevertheless, it is well-known that k-means has the major drawback of not being able to separate data points 581 that are not linearly separable in the given feature space (e.g., see Dhillon et al.(2004) and Cai et al.(2005))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:238	Spectral clustering algorithms were developed in response to this problem with k-means." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:238	The central idea behind spectral clustering is to (1) construct a low-dimensional space from the original (typically high-dimensional) space while retaining as much information about the original space as possible, and (2) cluster the data points in this low-dimensional space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:238	The rest of this section provides the details of spectral clustering." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:238	2.1 Algorithm Although there are several well-known spectral clustering algorithms in the literature (e.g., Weiss (1999), Shi and Malik (2000), Kannan et al.(2004)), we adopt the one proposed by Ng et al.(2002), as it is arguably the most widely-used." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="67:238	The reason why eigenvectors with large eigenvalues are used is that they capture the largest variance in the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:238	As a result, each of them can be thought of as revealing an important dimension of the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:238	2.2 Clustering with Eigenvectors As Ng et al.(2002) point out, different authors still disagree on which eigenvectors to use, and how to derive clusters from them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:238	There are two common methods for deriving clusters using the eigenvectors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:238	These methods will serve as our baselines in our evaluation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:238	1For brevity, we will refer to the eigenvector with the n-th largest eigenvalue simply as the n-th eigenvector." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:238	Method 1: Using the second eigenvector only The first method is to use only the second eigenvector, e2, to partition the points." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:238	Besides revealing one of the most important dimensions of the data, this eigenvector induces an intuitively ideal partition of the data  the partition induced by the minimum normalized cut of the similarity graph2, where the nodes are the data points and the edge weights are the pairwise similarity values of the points (Shi and Malik, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:238	Clustering in a onedimensional space is trivial: since we have a linearization of the points, all we need to do is to determine a threshold for partitioning the points." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:238	However, we follow Ng et al.(2002) and cluster using 2-means in this one-dimensional space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:238	Method 2: Using m eigenvectors Recall from Section 2.1 that after eigendecomposing the Laplacian matrix, each data point is represented by m co-ordinates." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:238	In the second method, we simply use 2-means to cluster the data points in this m-dimensional space, effectively exploiting all of the m eigenvectors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:238	3 Our Approach As mentioned before, sentiment-based clustering is challenging, in part due to the fact that the reviews can be clustered along more than one dimension." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:238	In this section, we propose and incorporate a user feedback mechanism into a spectral clustering algorithm, which makes it easy for a user to specify the dimension along which she wants to cluster the data points." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:238	Recall that our method first applies spectral clustering to reveal the most important dimensions of the data, and then lets the user select the desired dimension." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:238	To motivate the importance of user feedback, it helps to understand why the two baseline clustering algorithms described in Section 2.2, which are also based on spectral methods but do not rely on user feedback, may not always yield a sentiment-based clustering." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:238	To begin with, consider the first method, where only the second eigenvector is used to induce the partition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:238	Recall that the second eigenvector reveals the most prominent dimension of the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:238	Hence, if sentiment is not the most prominent dimension (which can happen if the non-sentiment-bearing 2Using the normalized cut (as opposed to the usual cut) ensures that the size of the two clusters are relatively balanced, avoiding trivial cuts where one cluster is empty and the other is full." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="89:238	582 words outnumber the sentiment-bearing words in the bag-of-words representation of a review), then the resulting clustering of the reviews may not be sentiment-oriented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:238	A similar line of reasoning can be used to explain why the second baseline clustering algorithm, which clusters based on all of the eigenvectors in the low-dimensional space, may not always work well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:238	Since each eigenvector corresponds to a different dimension (and, in particular, some of them correspond to non-sentiment dimensions), using all of them to represent a review may hamper the accurate computation of the similarity of two reviews as far as clustering along the sentiment dimension is concerned." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:238	In the rest of this section, we discuss the major steps of our user-feedback mechanism in detail." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:238	Step 1: Identify the important dimensions To identify the important dimensions of the given reviews, we take the top eigenvectors computed from the eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian matrix, which is in turn formed from the input similarity matrix." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:238	We compute the similarity between two reviews by taking the dot product of their feature vectors (see Section 4.1 for details on feature vector generation)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:238	Following Ng et al., we set the diagonal entries of the similarity matrix to 0." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:238	Step 2: Identify the relevant features Given the eigen-decomposition from Step 1, we first obtain the second through the fifth eigenvectors3, which as mentioned above, correspond to the most important dimensions of the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:238	Then, we ask the user to select one of the four dimensions defined by these eigenvectors according to their relevance to sentiment." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:199	1 Introduction There is considerable academic and commercial interest in processing subjective content in text, where subjective content refers to any expression of a private state such as an opinion or belief (Wiebe et al., 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:199	Important strands of work include the identification of subjective content and the determination of its polarity, i.e. whether a favourable or unfavourable opinion is expressed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:199	Automatic identification of subjective content often relies on word indicators, such as unigrams (Pang et al., 2002) or predetermined sentiment lexica (Wilson et al., 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:199	Thus, the word positive in the sentence This deal is a positive development for our company. gives a strong indication that the sentence contains a favourable opinion." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:199	However, such word-based indicators can be misleading for two reasons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:199	First, contextual indicators such as irony and negation can reverse subjectivity or polarity indications (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:199	Second, different word senses of a single word can actually be of different subjectivity or polarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:199	A typical subjectivity-ambiguous word, i.e. a word that has at least one subjective and at least one objective sense, is positive, as shown by the two example senses given below.1 (1) positive, electropositivehaving a positive electric charge;protons are positive (objective) (2) plus, positiveinvolving advantage or good; a plus (or positive) factor (subjective) We concentrate on this latter problem by automatically creating lists of subjective senses, instead of subjective words, via adding subjectivity labels for senses to electronic lexica, using the example of WordNet." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:199	This is important as the problem of subjectivity-ambiguity is frequent: We (Su and Markert, 2008) find that over 30% of words in our dataset are subjectivity-ambiguous." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:199	All items in the training/test data are seen as vertices in a graph with undirected weighted edges between them specifying how strong the similarity/association between two vertices is. We use minimum s-t cuts: the graph contains two particular vertices s (source, corresponds to subjective) and t (sink, corresponds to objective) and each vertex u is connected to s and t via a weighted edge that can express how likely u is to be classified as s or t in isolation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:199	Binary classification of the vertices is equivalent to splitting the graph into two disconnected subsets of all vertices, S and T with s  S and t  T. This corresponds to removing a set of edges from the graph." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:199	As similar items should be in the same part of the split, the best split is one which removes edges with low weights." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:199	In other words, a minimum cut problem is to find a partition of the graph which minimizes the following formula, where w(u,v) expresses the weight of an edge between two vertices." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:199	W(S,T) = summationdisplay uS,vT w(u,v) Globally optimal minimum cuts can be found in polynomial time and near-linear running time in practice, using the maximum flow algorithm (Pang and Lee, 2004; Cormen et al., 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:199	3.2 Why might Semi-supervised Minimum Cuts Work?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:199	We propose semi-supervised mincuts for subjectivity recognition on senses for several reasons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:199	First, our problem satisfies two major conditions necessary for using minimum cuts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:199	It is a binary classification problem (subjective vs. objective senses) as is needed to divide the graph into two components." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:199	Our dataset also lends itself naturally to s-t Mincuts as we have two different views on the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:199	Thus, the edges of a vertex (=sense) to the source/sink can be seen as the probability of a sense being subjective or objective without taking similaritytoothersensesintoaccount, forexampleviaconsidering only the sense gloss." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:199	In contrast, the edges between two senses can incorporate the WordNet relation hierarchy, which is a good source of similarity for our problem as many WordNet relations are subjectivity-preserving, i.e. if two senses are connected via such a relation they are likely to be both subjective or both objective.3 An example here is the antonym relation, where two antonyms such as goodmorally admirable and evil, wickedmorally bad or wrong are both subjective." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:199	Second, Mincuts can be easily expanded into a semi-supervised framework (Blum and Chawla, 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:199	This is essential as the existing labeled datasets for our problem are small." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:199	In addition, glosses are short, leading to sparse high dimensional vectors in standard feature representations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:199	Also, WordNet connections between different parts of the WordNet hierarchy can also be sparse, leading to relatively isolated senses in a graph in a supervised framework." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:199	Semi-supervised Mincuts allow us to import unlabeled data that can serve as bridges to isolated components." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:199	More importantly, as the unlabeled data can be chosen to be related to the labeled and test data, they might help pull test data to the right cuts (categories)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:199	3.3 Formulation of Semi-supervised Mincuts The formulation of our semi-supervised Mincut for sense subjectivity classification involves the following steps, which we later describe in more detail." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:199	1." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="86:199	Selection of unlabeled data: Random selection of unlabeled data might hurt the performance of Mincuts, as they might not be related to any sense in our training/test data (denoted by A)." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="7:84	1   Introduction In the community of sentiment analysis (Turney 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2009), transferring a sentiment classifier from one source domain to another target domain is still far from a trivial work, because sentiment expression often behaves with strong domain-specific nature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:84	Up to this time, many researchers have proposed techniques to address this problem, such as classifiers adaptation, generalizable features detection and so on (DaumeIII et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:84	Among these techniques, SCL (Structural Correspondence Learning) (Blitzer et al., 2006) is regarded as a promising method to tackle transfer-learning problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:84	The main idea behind SCL model is to identify correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features (or generalizable features)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:84	Pivot features behave similarly in both domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:84	If non-pivot features from different domains are correlated with many of the same pivot features, then we assume them to be corresponded with each other, and treat them similarly when training a sentiment classifier." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:84	However, SCL model treats each feature as well as each instance by an equivalent-weight strategy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:84	From the perspective of feature, this strategy fails to overcome the adverse influence of highfrequency domain-specific (HFDS) features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:84	For example, the words stock or market occurs frequently in most of stock reviews, so these nonsentiment features tend to have a strong correspondence with pivot features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:84	As a result, the representative ability of the other sentiment features will inevitably be weakened to some degree." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:84	To address this issue, we proposed Frequently Exclusively-occurring Entropy (FEE) to pick out HFDS features, and proposed a feature-weighted SCL model (FW-SCL) to adjust the influence of HFDS features in building correspondence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:84	The main idea of FW-SCL is to assign a smaller weight to HFDS features so that the adverse influence of HFDS features can be decreased." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:84	From the other perspective, the equivalentweight strategy of SCL model ignores the labels (positive or negative) of labeled instances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:84	Obviously, this is not a good idea." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:84	In fact, positive pivot features tend to occur in positive instances, so the correlations built on positive instances are more reliable than that built on negative instances; and vice versa." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:84	Consequently, utilization of labels of instances and pivot features can decrease the adverse influence of some co-occurrences, such as co-occurrences involved with positive pivot features and negative instances, or involved with negative pivot features and positive instances." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:84	In order to take into account the labels of labeled instances, we proposed an instanceweighted SCL model (IW-SCL), which assigns a larger weight to instances with the same label as the involved pivot feature." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="54:119	e) A snippet can be covered by several nuggets (e.g. both nuggets it is an honest book and it is a great book correspond to the same snippet It was such a great bookhonest and hard to read (content not language difficulty))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:119	On the other hand, regarding the use of the optional snippets, the main problem to address is to remove redundancy, because many of them are repeated for the same target, and we have to determine which snippet represents better the idea for the final summary, in order to avoid noisy irrelevant information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:119	4.1 Measuring the Performance of a Generic Summarization System Several participants in the TAC 2008 edition performed the OSP task by using generic summarization systems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:119	Most were adjusted by integrating an opinion classifier module so that the task could be fulfilled, but some were not (Bossard et al., 2008), (Hendrickx and Bosma, 2008)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:119	This fact made us realize that a generic summarizer could be used to achieve this task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:119	We wanted to analyze the effects of such a kind of summarizer to produce opinion summaries." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="61:119	The main idea employed is to score sentences of a document with regard to the word frequency count (WF), which can be combined with a Textual Entailment (TE) module." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:119	Although the first approach suggested for opinion summarization obtained much better results in the evaluation than the second one (see Section 3.1), we decided to run the generic system over both approaches, with and without applying TE, to 74 provide a more extent analysis and conclusions." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="64:119	The goal of these experiments was to determine whether the techniques used for a generic summarizer would have a positive influence in selecting the main relevant information to become part of the final summary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:119	4.2 Results and Discussion We re-evaluated the summaries generated by the generic system following the nuggets list provided by the TAC 2008 organization, and counting manually the number of nuggets that were covered in the summaries." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="71:119	Table 2 points out the results for all the approaches reported." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:119	We have also considered the results derived from our participation in the TAC 2008 conference (OpSum-1 and OpSum-2), in order to analyze whether they have been improved or not." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="75:119	It benefits the Precision value, because a shorter summary contains greater ratio of relevant information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:119	On the other hand, taking into consideration the Fmeasure value only, it can be seen that the approach combining TE and WF, for the sentences in the first approach, has beaten significantly the best F-measure result among the participants of TAC 2008 (please see Table 3), increasing its performance by 20% (with respect to WF only), and improving by approximately 80% with respect to our first approach submitted to TAC 2008." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:254	Polarity classification, whose goal is to determine whether the sentiment expressed in a document is thumbs up or thumbs down, is arguably one of the most popular tasks in document-level sentiment analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:254	Unlike topic-based text classification, where a high accuracy can be achieved even for datasets with a large number of classes (e.g., 20 Newsgroups), polarity classification appears to be a more difficult task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:254	One reason topic-based text classification is easier than polarity classification is that topic clusters are typically well-separated from each other, resulting from the fact that word usage differs considerably between two topically-different documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:254	On the other hand, many reviews are sentimentally ambiguous for a variety of reasons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:254	For instance, an author of a movie review may have negative opinions of the actors but at the same time talk enthusiastically about how much she enjoyed the plot." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:254	Here, the review is ambiguous because she discussed both the positive and negative aspects of the movie, which is not uncommon in reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:254	As another example, a large portion of a movie review may be devoted exclusively to the plot, with the author only briefly expressing her sentiment at the end of the review." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:254	In this case, the review is ambiguous because the objective material in the review, which bears no sentiment orientation, significantly outnumbers its subjective counterpart." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:254	Realizing the challenges posed by ambiguous reviews, researchers have explored a number of techniques to improve supervised polarity classifiers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:254	For instance, Pang and Lee (2004) train an independent subjectivity classifier to identify and remove objective sentences from a review prior to polarity classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:254	Koppel and Schler (2006) use neutral reviews to help improve the classification of positive and negative reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:254	More recently, McDonald et al.(2007) have investigated a model for jointly performing sentenceand document-level sentiment analysis, allowing the relationship between the two tasks to be captured and exploited." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:254	However, the increased sophistication of supervised polarity classifiers has also resulted in their increased dependence on annotated data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:254	For instance, Koppel and Schler needed to manually identify neutral reviews to train their polarity classifier, and McDonald et al.s joint model requires that each sentence in a review be labeled with polarity information." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="24:254	Nevertheless, a solution to unsupervised polarity classification is of practical significance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:254	One reason is that the vast majority of supervised polarity 701 classification systems are domain-specific." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="27:254	As Blitzer et al.(2007) point out, this data collection process can be prohibitively expensive, especially since product features can change over time." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="46:254	A popular choice is k-means." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:254	Nevertheless, it is well-known that k-means has the major drawback of not being able to separate data points that are not linearly separable in the given feature space (e.g, see Dhillon et al.(2004))." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="50:254	The central idea behind spectral clustering is to (1) construct a low-dimensional space from the original (typically high-dimensional) space while retaining as much information about the original space as possible, and (2) cluster the data points in this lowdimensional space." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:254	2.2 Algorithm Although there are several well-known spectral clustering algorithms in the literature (e.g., Weiss (1999), Meila and Shi (2001), Kannan et al.(2004)), we adopt the one proposed by Ng et al.(2002), as it is arguably the most widely used." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="68:254	As mentioned in the introduction, we employ a mine the easy, classify the hard approach to polarity classification, where we (1) identify and classify the easy (i.e., unambiguous) reviews with the help of a spectral clustering algorithm; (2) manually label a small number of hard (i.e., ambiguous) reviews selected by an active learner; and (3) using the reviews labeled thus far, apply a transductive learner to label the remaining (ambiguous) reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:254	In this section, we discuss each of these steps in detail." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:254	3.1 Identifying Unambiguous Reviews We begin by preprocessing the reviews to be classified." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:254	Specifically, we tokenize and downcase each review and represent it as a vector of unigrams, using frequency as presence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:254	In addition, we remove from the vector punctuation, numbers, words of length one, and words that occur in a single review only." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:254	Finally, following the common practice in the information retrieval community, we remove words with high document frequency, many of which are stopwords or domainspecific general-purpose words (e.g., movies in the movie domain)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:254	A preliminary examination of our evaluation datasets reveals that these words 1For brevity, we will refer to the eigenvector with the n-th largest eigenvalue simply as the n-th eigenvector." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:254	typically comprise 12% of a vocabulary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:254	The decision of exactly how many terms to remove from each dataset is subjective: a large corpus typically requires more removals than a small corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:254	To be consistent, we simply sort the vocabulary by document frequency and remove the top 1.5%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:254	Recall that in this step we use spectral clustering to identify unambiguous reviews." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:254	To make use of spectral clustering, we first create a similarity matrix, defining the similarity between two reviews as the dot product of their feature vectors, but following Ng et al.(2002), we set its diagonal entries to 0." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:254	We then perform an eigen-decomposition of this matrix, as described in Section 2.2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:254	Finally, using the resulting eigenvectors, we partition the length-normalized reviews into two sets." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:254	As Ng et al. point out, different authors still disagree on which eigenvectors to use, and how to derive clusters from them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:254	To create two clusters, the most common way is to use only the second eigenvector, as Shi and Malik (2000) proved that this eigenvector induces an intuitively ideal partition of the data  the partition induced by the minimum normalized cut of the similarity graph2, where the nodes are the data points and the edge weights are the pairwise similarity values of the points." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:254	Clustering in a one-dimensional space is trivial: since we have a linearization of the points, all we need to do is to determine a threshold for partitioning the points." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:254	A common approach is to set the threshold to zero." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:254	In other words, all points whose value in the second eigenvector is positive are classified as positive, and the remaining points are classified as negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:254	However, we found that the second eigenvector does not always induce a partition of the nodes that corresponds to the minimum normalized cut." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:254	One possible reason is that Shi and Maliks proof assumes the use of a Laplacian matrix that is different from the one used by Ng et al. To address this problem, we use the first five eigenvectors: for each eigenvector, we (1) use each of its n elements as a threshold to independently generate n partitions, (2) compute the normalized cut value for each partition, and (3) find the minimum of the n cut values." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:254	We then select the eigenvector that corresponds to the smallest of the five minimum cut values." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:254	Next, we identify the ambiguous reviews from 2Using the normalized cut (as opposed to the usual cut) ensures that the size of the two clusters are relatively balanced, avoiding trivial cuts where one cluster is empty and the other is full." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="104:254	Recall that the goal of this step is not only to identify the unambiguous reviews, but also to annotate them as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE, so that they can serve as seeds for semi-supervised learning in a later step." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:254	If we have a good 2-way clustering of the seeds, we can simply annotate each cluster (by sampling a handful of its reviews) rather than each seed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:254	To reiterate, removing the ambiguous data points can help produce a good clustering of their unambiguous counterparts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:254	Second, as an ambiguous data point, D3 can in principle be assigned to any of the two clusters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:254	According to the second eigenvector, it should be assigned to the negative cluster; but if feature #4 were irrelevant, it should be assigned to the positive cluster." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:188	1 Introduction Semantic resources are extremely valuable for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as evidenced by the wide popularity of WordNet (Miller, 1990) and a multitude of efforts to create similar WordNets for additional languages (e.g.(Atserias et al., 1997; Vossen, 1998; Stamou et al., 2002))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:188	Semantic resources can take many forms, but one of the most basic types is a dictionary that associates a word (or word sense) with one or more semantic categories (hypernyms)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:188	Many domains use specialized vocabularies and jargon that are not adequately represented in broad-coverage resources (e.g., medicine, genomics, etc.)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:188	Furthermore, even relatively general text genres, such as news, contain subdomains that require extensive knowledge of specific semantic categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:188	For example, our work uses a corpus of news articles about terrorism that includes many arcane weapon terms (e.g., M-79, AR-15, an-fo, and gelignite)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:188	Similarly, our disease-related documents mention obscure diseases (e.g., psittacosis) and contain many informal terms, abbreviations, and spelling variants that do not even occur in most medical dictionaries." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="26:188	In contrast, corpus-based methods can learn specialized terminology directly from a domain-specific corpus, but accuracy can be a problem because most corpora are relatively small." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="64:188	Basilisks bootstrapping process has two main steps: Pattern Pool Creation and Candidate Word Selection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:188	First, Basilisk applies the AutoSlog pattern generator (Riloff, 1996) to create a set of lexicosyntactic patterns that, collectively, can extract every noun phrase in the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:188	Basilisk then ranks the patterns according to how often they extract the seed words, under the assumption that patterns which extract known category members are likely to extract other category members as well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:188	The highest-ranked patterns are placed in a pattern pool." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:188	Second, Basilisk gathers every noun phrase that is extracted by at least one pattern in the pattern pool, and designates each head noun as a candidate for the semantic category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:188	The candidates are then scored and ranked." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:188	For each candidate, Basilisk collects all of the patterns that extracted that word, computes the logarithm of the number of seeds extracted by each of those patterns, and finally computes the average of these log values as the score for the candidate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:188	Intuitively, a candidate word receives a high score if it was extracted by patterns that, on average, also extract many known category members." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:188	The N highest ranked candidates are automatically added to the list of seed words, taking a leap of faith that they are true members of the semantic category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:188	The bootstrapping process then repeats, using the larger set of seed words as known category members in the next iteration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:188	Basilisk learns many good category members, but its accuracy varies a lot across semantic categories (Thelen and Riloff, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:188	One problem with Basilisk, and bootstrapping algorithms in general, is that accuracy tends to deteriorate as bootstrapping progresses." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:188	Basilisk generates candidates by identifying the contexts in which they occur and words unrelated to the desired category can sometimes also occur in those contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:188	Some patterns consistently extract members of several semantic classes; for example, attack on <NP> will extract both people (attack on the president) and buildings (attack on the U.S. embassy)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="82:188	This improved Basilisks accuracy, but by a relatively small amount, and this approach depends on the often unrealistic assumption that a word cannot belong to more than one semantic category." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="91:188	Turney (Turney, 2001; Turney, 2002) reported that the NEAR operator outperformed simple page co-occurrence for his purposes; our early experiments informally showed the same for this work." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:188	We want our technique to remain weakly supervised, so we do not want to require additional human input or effort beyond what is already required for Basilisk." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:188	With this in mind, we investigated two types of collocation relations as possible indicators of semantic class membership: Hypernym Collocation: We compute cooccurrence statistics between the candidate word and the name of the targeted semantic class (i.e., the words hypothesized hypernym)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="99:188	Here the intuition is that members of the same semantic category tend to occur near one another in lists, for example." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:188	As a statistical measure of co-occurrence, we compute a variation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), which is defined as: PMI(x,y) = log( p(x,y)p(x)p(y)) where p(x,y) is the probability that x and y are collocated (near each other) on a Web page, p(x) is the probability that x occurs on a Web page, and p(y) is the probability that y occurs on a Web page." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:188	p(x) is calculated as count(x)N , where count(x) is the number of hits returned by AltaVista, searching for x by itself, and N is the total number of documents on the World Wide Web at the time the query is made." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:188	Similarly, p(x,y) is count(x NEAR y)N . Given this, the PMI equation can be rewritten as: log(N) +log(count(x NEAR y)count(x)count(y)) N is not known, but it is the same for every query (assuming the queries were made at roughly the same time)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:188	We will use these scores solely to compare the relative goodness of candidates, so we can omit N from the equation because it will not change the relative ordering of the scores." ></td>
