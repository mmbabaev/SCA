	<td class="line x" title="673:730	Conclusions The method presented in this paper takes advantage of two linguistic phenomena, both proven to be very useful for sense disambiguation: the different mapping between words and word senses among different languages, and the importance of lexical co-occurrence within syntactic relations." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="675:730	Using a bilingual lexicon and a monolingual corpus of the target language, we can acquire statistics on word senses automatically, without manual tagging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="676:730	As explained in Section 7, this method has significant practical and theoretical advantages over the use of aligned bilingual corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="677:730	We pay for these advantages by introducing an additional level of noise, in mapping individual words independently to the other language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="678:730	Our results show, however, that the precision of the selection algorithm is high despite this additional noise." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="679:730	This work also emphasizes the importance of lexical co-occurrence within syntactic relations for the resolution of lexical ambiguity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="680:730	Co-occurrences found in a large corpus reflect a huge amount of semantic knowledge, which was traditionally constructed by hand." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="681:730	Moreover, frequency data for such co-occurrences reflect both linguistic and domain-specific preferences, thus indicating not only what is possible, but also what is probable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="682:730	It is important to notice that frequency information on lexical co-occurrence was found to be much more predictive than single word frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="683:730	In the three experiments we reported, there were 61 cases in which the two types of information contradicted each other, favoring different target words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="684:730	In 56 of these cases (92%), it was the most frequent lexical co-occurrence, and not the most frequent word, that predicted the correct translation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="685:730	This result may raise relevant hypotheses for psycholinguistic research, which has indicated the relevance of word frequencies to human sense disambiguation (e.g. , Simpson and Burgess 1988)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="686:730	We suggest that the high precision achieved in the experiments relies on two characteristics of the ambiguity phenomena, namely the sparseness and redundancy of the disambiguating data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="687:730	By sparseness we mean that within the large space of alternative interpretations produced by ambiguous utterances, only a small portion is commonly used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="688:730	Therefore, the chance that an inappropriate interpretation is observed in the corpus (in other contexts) is low." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="689:730	Redundancy relates to the fact that different informants (such as different lexical relations or deep understanding) tend to support rather than contradict one another, and therefore the chance of picking a 'wrong' informant is low." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="690:730	It is interesting to compare our method with some aspects of the statistical machine translation system of Brown et al.(1990)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="695:730	It seems, however, that Brown et al. expect that target word selection would be determined mainly by translation probabilities (the second factor in the above term), which should be derived from a bilingual corpus (Brown et al. 1990, p. 79)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="696:730	This view is reflected also in their elaborate method for target word selection (Brown et al. 1991), in which better estimates of translation probabilities are achieved as a result of word sense disambiguation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="697:730	Our method, on the other hand, incorporates only 592 Ido Dagan and Alon Itai Word Sense Disambiguation target language probabilities and ignores any notion of translation probabilities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="698:730	It thus demonstrates a possible trade-off between these two types of probabilities: using more informative statistics of the target language may compensate for the lack of translation probabilities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="699:730	For our system, the more informative statistics are achieved by syntactic analysis of both the source and target languages, instead of the simple tri-gram model used by Brown et al.

	<td class="line x" title="2:195	Solutions to this problem are applicable to the more general task of selecting the positive term from the pair." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:195	Using automatically collected data, the accuracy and applicability of each method is quantified, and a statistical analysis of the significance of the results is performed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:195	We show that some simple methods are indeed good indicators for the answer to the problem while other proposed methods fail to perform better than would be attributable to chance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:195	In addition, one of the simplest methods, text frequency, dominates all others." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:195	We also apply two generic statistical learning methods for combining the indications of the individual methods, and compare their performance to the simple methods." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:195	The most sophisticated complex learning method offers a small, but statistically significant, improvement over the original tests." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:195	1 Introduction The concept of markedness originated in the work of Prague School linguists (Jakobson, 1984a) and refers to relationships between two complementary or antonymous terms which can be distinguished by the presence or absence of a feature (+A versus --A)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:195	Such an opposition can occur at various linguistic levels." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:195	For example, a markedness contrast can arise at the morphology level, when one of the two words is derived from the other and therefore contains an explicit formal marker such as a prefix; e.g., profitable-unprofitable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:195	Markedness contrasts also appear at the semantic level in many pairs of gradable antonymous adjectives, especially scalar ones (Levinson, 1983), such as tall-short." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:195	The marked and unmarked elements of such pairs function in different ways." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:195	The unmarked adjective (e.g. , tall) can be used in how-questions to refer to the property described by both adjectives in the pair (e.g. , height), but without any implication about the modified item relative to the norm for the property." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:195	For example, the question How tall is Jack?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:195	can be answered equally well by four or seven feet." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:195	In contrast, the marked element of the opposition cannot be used generically; when used in a how-question, it implies a presupposition of the speaker regarding the relative position of the modified item on the adjectival scale." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:195	Thus, the corresponding question using the marked term of the opposition (How short is Jack)?" ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:195	conveys an implication on the part of the speaker that Jack is indeed short; the distinguishing feature A expresses this presupposition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:195	While markedness has been described in terms of a distinguishing feature A, its definition does not specify the type of this feature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:195	Consequently, several different types of features have been employed, which has led into some confusion about the meaning of the term markedness." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:195	Following Lyons (1977), we distinguish between formal markedness where the opposition occurs at the morphology level (i.e. , one of the two terms is derived from the other through inflection or affixation) and semantic markedness where the opposition occurs at the semantic level as in the example above." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:195	When two antonymous terms are also morphologically related, the formally unmarked term is usually also the semantically unmarked one (for example, clear-unclear)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:195	However, this correlation is not universal; consider the examples unbiased-biased and independent-dependent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:195	In any case, semantic markedness is the more interesting of the two and the harder to determine, both for humans and computers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:195	Various tests for determining markedness in general have been proposed by linguists (see Section 3)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:195	However, although potentially automatic versions of some of these have been successfully applied to the problem at the phonology level (Trubetzkoy, 1939; Greenberg, 1966), little work has been done on the empirical validation or the automatic application of those tests at higher levels (but see (Ku~era, 1982) for an empirical analysis of a proposed markedness test at the syntactic level; some more narrowly focused empirical work has also been done on markedness in second language acquisition)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:195	In this paper 197 we analyze the performance of several linguistic tests for the selection of the semantically unmarked term out of a pair of gradable antonymous adjectives." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:195	We describe a system that automatically extracts the relevant data for these tests from text corpora and corpora-based databases, and use this system to measure the applicability and accuracy of each method." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:195	We apply statistical tests to determine the significance of the results, and then discuss the performance of complex predictors that combine the answers of the linguistic tests according to two general statistical learning methods, decision trees and loglinear regression models." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:195	2 Motivation The goal of our work is twofold: First, we are interested in providing hard, quantitative evidence on the performance of markedness tests already proposed in the linguistics literature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:195	Such tests are based on intuitive observations and/or particular theories of semantics, but their accuracy has not been measured on actual data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:195	The results of our analysis can be used to substantiate theories which are compatible with the empirical evidence, and thus offer insight into the complex linguistic phenomenon of antonymy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:195	The second purpose of our work is practical applications." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:195	The semantically unmarked term is almost always the positive term of the opposition (Boucher and Osgood, 1969); e.g., high is positive, while low is negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:195	Therefore, an automatic method for determining markedness values can also be used to determine the polarity of antonyms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:195	The work reported in this paper helps clarify which types of data and tests are useful for such a method and which are not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:195	The need for an automatic corpus-based method for the identification of markedness becomes apparent when we consider the high number of adjectives in unrestricted text and the domain-dependence of markedness values." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:195	In the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981), a large machinereadable annotated word list, 25,547 of the 150,837 entries (16.94%) are classified as adjectives, not including past participles; if we only consider regularly used grammatical categories for each word, the percentage of adjectives rises to 22.97%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:195	For comparison, nouns (the largest class) account for 51.28% and 57.47% of the words under the two criteria." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:195	In addition, while adjectives tend to have prevalent markedness and polarity values in the language at large, frequently these values are negated in specific domains or contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:195	For example, healthy is in most contexts the unmarked member of the opposition healthy:sick; but in a hospital setting, sickness rather than health is expected, so sick becomes the unmarked term." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:195	The methods we describe are based on the form of the words and their overall statistical properties, and thus cannot predict specific occurfences of markedness reversals." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:195	But they can predict the prevalent markedness value for each adjective in a given domain, something which is impractical to do by hand separately for each domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:195	We have built a large system for the automatic, domain-dependent classification of adjectives according to semantic criteria." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:195	The first phase of our system (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993) separates adjectives into groups of semantically related ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:195	We extract markedness values according to the methods described in this paper and use them in subsequent phases of the system that further analyze these groups and determine their scalar structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:195	An automatic method for extracting polarity information would also be useful for the augmentation of lexico-semantic databases such as WordNet (Miller et al. , 1990), particularly when the method accounts for the specificities of the domain sublanguage; an increasing number of NLP systems rely on such databases (e.g. , (Resnik, 1993; Knight and Luk, 1994))." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="48:195	Finally, knowledge of polarity can be combined with corpus-based collocation extraction methods (Smadja, 1993) to automatically produce entries for the lexical functions used in MeaningText Theory (Mel'~uk and Pertsov, 1987) for text generation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:195	For example, knowing that hearty is a positive term enables the assignment of the collocation hearty eater to the lexical function entry MAGS( eater)=-hearty." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:195	1 3 Tests for Semantic Markedness Markedness in general and semantic markedness in particular have received considerable attention in the linguistics literature." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:195	Consequently, several tests for determining markedness have been proposed by linguists." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:195	Most of these tests involve human judgments (Greenberg, 1966; Lyons, 1977; Waugh, 1982; Lehrer, 1985; Ross, 1987; Lakoff, 1987) and are not suitable for computer implementation." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="54:189	2.2 Focused Sample and Base Sample For our experiments of automatic term suggestion, we selected a predefined topic called 'European Politics and Business'." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="65:189	2.3 Experimental Procedure The general method we adopted is as follows." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="69:189	The terms suggested are split into three categones: single word terms, two-word terms and multi-word terms (or phrases)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:189	The following three sections descnbe in detail the methods for generating each of the three categories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:189	2.4 Suggesting Single Word Terms Automatically suggesting single word terms as being topically oriented has been most challenging." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:189	Our experiments indicated that the ffirst order' statistics, probability and entropy alone, are not sufficient for gathering information about the topicality of a word in running text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:189	The information in both measurements is essentially equivalent since entropy is just the log inverse of probability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:189	We found that the 'second-order' statistics, such as vadance or standard deviation of term frequencies across documents, provide greater insight into topicality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:189	We selected the interval between the occurrences of a word as the basis for analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:189	Our intuitions led us to believe that topical single words should appear more frequently and more regularly, i.e. at approximately even intervals, in the focused sample than in the base sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:189	The focused sample represents, more or less, a topical sublanguage set while the base sample a general language set." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:189	Unlike probability and entropy statistics which yield average scores for the whole document, the use of interval makes it possible to get an 'instantaneous' measure at any location in the document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:189	More specifically, an interval can be measured 'instantaneously' at any point in the text between the occurrences of a particular word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:189	Though using interval alone might still not be sufficient for identifying word topicality, it allowed us to measure the vadance which would help identify words that were always changing in their rate of occurrences." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:189	Thus, three scores were generated for each word: the mean log interval, the standard deviation of the mean log interval, and the normalized standard deviation of the mean log interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:189	The use of a log scale for these measurements is to minimize the effect of unduly large variations in words with long mean intervals." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:189	The normalized standard deviation is produced by simply dividing the raw standard deviation by the mean log interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:189	In most cases, raw standard deviation is found to be larger for words having long mean intervals." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:189	In order to compare the standard deviations across words of different intervals, we found this normalization process quite useful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:189	134 i After scores were generated for all the words in both the focused sample and the base sample, score comparisons between the two samples were carried out in two ways: comparing the intervals and comparing the standard deviations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:189	To compare the intervals, the =base' mean log interval was subtracted from the 'focused' mean log Interval and divided by the raw standard deviation from the base sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:189	The result represents the change of mean log intervals." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:189	More explicitly, it yields the number of standard deviations that the 'focused' mean log interval is different from the =base' mean log interval." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:189	The more negative;the value, the more significant the change, and the more prominent the word would appear in the focused sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:189	To compare the standard deviations, the normalized =base' standard deviation was subtracted from the normalized 'focused' standard deviation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:189	The difference symbolizes how the word is distributed in ~e focused sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:189	The more negative the value is, the more 'bursty' the word is distributed, and the more likely it is content oriented since 'content words tend to appear in 'bursts' (Church and Mercer 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="94:189	If a single word term is found in both data samples and it receives negative scores from both interval and standard deviation comparisons, it would be included in the suggested list as being topical onented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:189	2.5 Suggesting Two-Word Terms The method for suggesting two-word terms tumed out to be much simpler than that for single word terms though the same techniques are equally applicable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:189	Here, the traditional mutual information score was used." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:189	As stated in Church, et al.(1991) and elsewhere, the mutual information measurement can be expressed as:." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:189	(:p(WlW2)) l(WlW2) = lg~,p(wl)p(w2) where p(wlw2) is the frequency in the data collection of the two-word compound (wl,w2); and p(wl) and p(w2) the frequency of the word constituents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:189	The highest mutual information score indicates that the individual probabilities are low while the two words occur together frequently." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:189	Two steps led to our automatic suggestion of topic-oriented two-word terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:189	First, the mutual information score was computed for each pair of words that occur in each of the two samples." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:189	To capture topicality, we were only interested in pairs of words with high mutual information scores." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:189	Therefore, any pair which contained =closed class' words, such as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, or single letters, digit numbers, or overly common verbs like 'give', 'take', etc. , were excluded." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:189	Such an exclusion not only helped getting pairs of words with high mutual information scores, but also sped up computation significantly." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:189	A threshold value was also set such that if any two-word unit occurred less than 3 times in the sample or received a mutual information score lower than 6.0, it was eliminated and would not participate in the next comparison measurement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:189	135 With the mutual information scores in hand, a 'delta' score was generated by subtracting the 'base' mutual information score from the ffocused' mutual information score." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:189	Topically, prominent two-word terms normally have lower scores in the focused sample that is 'keyed' to their topic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:189	This is because the constituent words distribute in wider range of contexts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:189	The probability of them occurring separately increases relative to the probability of them occurring together (Steier and Belew 1994)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:189	Therefore, the more negative the 'delta' score, the more topically sensitive the two-word term is. If a two-word term occurs in both data samples and receives a negative 'delta' score, it would be included in the suggested list as being topically onented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:189	2.6 Suggesting Multi-Word Terms When automatically suggesting content two-word terms, we looked at the mutual information scores for adjacent words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:189	For multi-word terms, the mutual information score was calculated for non-adjacent words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="114:189	Our intuitions led us to believe that if there is a significant statistical linkage, i.e. a high mutual information score, between such a pair of words, it is highly possible that they belong to a larger linguistic component." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="115:189	Our first step was to compute mutual information scores for a word unit separated by a distance of two (i.e. having one unspecified word separating them)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="116:189	Two cdteda apply when selecting 'interesting' word units." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="117:189	Their mutual information score must be 10 or greater." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="118:189	Following the observations by Steier and Belew (Steier and Belew1994), we only selected pairs which received lower mutual information score in the focused sample than in the base sample." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="119:189	Once an 'interesting' word unit of distance two was selected, a concordance was built of all sentences containing that word unit." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="120:189	These sentences were compared for matching text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="121:189	If a stdng of text was found to include that word unit and, at the same time, occur most frequently in the concordance, its leading and trailing 'closed-set' words (if any) were chopped off." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:189	The remaining text stdng was presented as a suggested multi-word term." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="124:189	RESULTS and DISCUSSION 3.1 Suggested Single Terms The focused sample drawn from the 1988 UPI data contains 12,065 unique words." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:316	The same clustering technique is then applied to the classification of multiword compounds." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:316	In order to avoid the explosion of the number of compounds to be handled, compounds in a small subclass are bundled and treated as a single compound." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:316	Another merit of this approach is that we can avoid the data sparseness problem which is ubiquitous in corpus statistics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:316	The quality of one of the obtained compound classes is examined and compared to a conventional approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:316	1 Introduction One of the fundamental issues concerning corpus-based NLP is that we can never expect to know from the training data all the necessary quantitative information for the words that might occur in the test data if the vocabulary is large enough to cope with a real world domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:316	In view of the effectiveness of class-based n-gram language models against the data sparseness problem (Kneser and Ney 1993, Ueberla 1995), it is expected that classes of words are also useful for NLP tasks in such a way that statistics on classes are used whenever statistics on individual words are unavailable or unreliable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:316	An ideal type of clusters for NLP is the one which guarantees mutual substitutability, in terms of both syntactic and semantic soundness, among words in the same class (Harris 1951, Brill and Marcus 1992)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:316	Take, for example, the following sentences." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="17:316	(d) He went to the house by the sea." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:316	Suppose that we want to parse sentences using a statistical parser and that sentences (a) and (b) appeared in the training and test data, respectively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:316	Since (a) is in the training data, we know that the prepositional phrase by car is attached to the main verb went, not to the noun phrase the house." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:316	Sentence (b) is quite similar to (a) in meaning, and identical to (a) in sentence structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:316	Now if the words apartment and bus are unknown to the parsing system *A part of this work is done when the author was at ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:316	28 (i.e. never occurred in the training data), then sentence (b) must look to the system very much like (c), and it will be very hard for the parsing system to tell the difference in sentence structure between (c) and (d)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:316	However, if the system has access to a predefined set of classes of words, and if car and bus are in the same class, and house and apartme.nt are in another class, it will not be hard for the system to detect the similarity between (a) and (b) and assign the correct sentence structure to (b) without confusing it with (d)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:316	The same argument holds for an example-based machine translation system." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:316	In that case, an appropriate translation of (b) is expected to be derived with an example translation of (a) if the system has an access to the classes of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:316	Therefore, it is desirable that we build clustering of the vocabulary in terms of mutual substitutability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:316	Furthermore, clustering is much more useful if the clusters are of variable granularity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:316	Suppose, for example, that we have two sets of clusters, one is finer than the other, and that word-1 and word-2 are in different finer classes." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="19:100	Though what constitutes a good term still remains to be answered, we know that a good term can be a word stem, a single word, a multiple word term (a phrase), or simply a syntactic unit." ></td>

	<td class="line pc" title="24:100	Tools like Xtract (Smadja 1993) were based on the work of Church and others, but made a step forward by incorporating various statistical measurements like z-score and variance of distribution, as well as shallow linguistic techniques like part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization of input data and partial parsing of raw output." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:100	Exemplary linguistic approaches can be found in the work by Str-zalkowsky (1993) where a fast and accurate syntactic parser is the prerequisite for the selection of significant phrasal terms." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="167:291	For each such comparison, four values of ~ were computed: ~:1: agreement on the evaluation of whether or not a pair should be immediately rejected or retained; ~2: agreement, for the retained pairs, on the type V, P, or I assigned to the pair; ~a: agreement, for the retained pairs, on whether to classify the pair as being useful for constructing a domain-specific glossary; g4: agreement, for the retained pairs, on whether to classify the pair as being useful for constructing a general usage glossary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="168:291	In each case, the computation of the agreement statistic took into account those cases, if any, where the annotator could not arrive at a decision for this case and opted simply to throw it out." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="169:291	Resulting values for inter-rater reliability are shown in Table 4; the six annotators are identified as A1, A2,  A6; and each value of ~ reflects the comparison between that annotator and the group annotation." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="171:291	The outlandish values for ~3, despite high rates of absolute agreement on that dimension of annotation, are explained by the fact that the ~ statistic is known to be highly problematic as a measure of inter-rater reliability when one of the categories that can be chosen is overwhelmingly likely (Grove et al. , 1981; Spitznagel and Helzer, 1985)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="172:291	Intuitively this is not surprising: we designed the experiment to yield a predominance of domain-specific terms, by means of the MRD and Hansards filters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="173:291	Our having succeeded, there is a very high probability that the 'Specific' annotation will be selected by any two annotators, because it appears so very frequently; as a result the actual agreement rate for that annotation doesn't actually look all that different from what one would get by chance, and so the ~ values are low." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="174:291	The values of ~3 for annotators 4 and 5 emphasize quite clearly that ~ is measuring not the level of absolute agreement, hut the distinguishability of that level of agreement from chance." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="176:291	Evaluated on a very small (400,000 word) corpus, the system shows real promise as a method of processing small domain-specific corpora in order to propose candidate single-word translations: once likely general usage terms are automatically filtered out, the system obtains precision up to 89% at levels of recall very conservatively estimated in the range of 30-40% on domain-specific terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="177:291	Of the proposed entries not immediately suitable for inclusion in a translation lexicon, many represent part-of-speech divergences (of the protect/protdgg variety) and a smaller number incomplete entries (of the immddiatement/right variety) that would nonetheless be helpful if used as the basis for a bilingual concordance search -for example, a search for French segments containing immddiatemeut in the vicinity of English segments containing right would most likely yield up the obvious correspondence between immgdiatement and right away." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="6:187	The main idea behind the workbench is the independence of the text representation and text analysis phases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:187	At the representation phase the text is converted from a sequence of characters to features of interest by means of the annotation tools." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:187	At the analysis phase those features are used by statistics gathering and inference tools for finding significant correlations in the texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:187	The analysis tools are independent of particular assumptions about the nature of the feature-set and work on the abstract level of featureelements represented as SGML items." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:187	1 Introduction There is increasing agreement that progress in various areas of language engineering needs large collections of unconstrained language material." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:187	Such corpora are emerging and are proving to be important research tools in areas such as lexicography, text understanding and information extraction, spoken language understanding, the evaluation of parsers, the construction of large-scale lexica, etc. The key idea of corpus oriented language analysis is to collect frequencies of 'interesting' events and then run statistical inferences on the basis of those frequencies." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="12:187	For instance, one might be interested in frequencies of co-occurences of a word with other words and phrases (collocations) (Smadja, 1993), or one might be interested in inducing wordclasses from the text by collecting frequencies of the left and right context words for a word in focus (Finch&Chater, 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:187	Thus, the building blocks of the 'interesting' events might be words, their morpho-syntactic properties (e.g. part-of-speech, suffix, etc.), phrases or their sub-phrases (e.g. headnoun of a noun group), etc. The 'interesting' events usually also specify the relation between those building blocks such as 'the two words should occur next to each other or in the same sentence'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:187	In this paper we describe a workbench for uncovering that kind of internal structure in natural language texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:187	2 Data Level Integration The underlying idea behind our workbench is data level integration of abstract data processing tools by means of structured streams." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:187	The idea of using an open set of modular tools with stream input/output (IO) is akin to the philosophy behind UNIX." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:187	This allows for localization of specific data processing or manipulation tasks so we can use different combinations of the same tools in a pipeline for fulfilling different tasks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:187	Our architecture, however, imposes an additional constraint on the IO streams: they should have a common syntactic format which is realized as SGML markup (Goldfarb, 1990)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:187	A detailed comparison of this SGML-oriented architecture with more traditional data-base oriented architectures can be found in (McKelvie et al. , 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:187	As a markup device an SGML element has a label (L), a pre-specified set of attributes (attr) and can have character data: <L attr=val attr=val>character data</L> SGML elements can also include other elements thus producing tree-like structures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:187	For instance, a document can comprise sections which consist of a title and a body-text and the body-text can consist of sentences each of which has its number stated as an attribute, has its contents as character data and can include other marked elements such as pre-tokenized phrases and dates as shown in Figure I. Such structures are described in Document Type Definition (DTD) files which are used to check whether an SGML document is syntactically correct, i.e. whether its SGML elements have only pre-specified attributes and include only the right kinds of other SGML elements." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:187	So, for instance, if in the document shown 372 in Figure 1 we had a header element (H) under an S element this would be detected as a violation of the defined structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:187	An important property of SGML is that defining a rigorous syntactic format does not set any assumptions on the semantics of the data and it is up to a tool to assign a specific interpretation to a particular SGML item or its attributes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:187	Thus a tool in our architecture is a piece of software which uses an SGMLhandling Application Programmer Interface (API) for all its data access to corpora and performs some useful task, whether exploiting markup which has previously been added by other tools, or itself adding new markup to the stream(s) and without destroying the previously added markup." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:187	This approach allows us to remain entirely within the SGML paradigm for corpus markup while allowing us to be very general in designing our tools, each of which can be used for many purposes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:187	Furthermore, through the ability to pipe data through processes, the UNIX operating system itself provides the natural 'glue' for integrating data-level applications together." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:187	The API methodology is very widely used in the software industry to integrate software components to form finished applications, often making use of some glue environment to stick the pieces together (e.g. tcl/tk, Visual Basic, Delphi, etc.)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:187	However, we choose to integrate our applications at the data level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:187	Rather than define a set of functions which can be called to perform tasks, we define a set of representations for how information which is typically produced by the tasks is actually represented." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:187	For natural language processing, there are many advantages to the data level integration approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:187	Let us take the practical example of a tokenizer." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:187	Rather than provide a set of functions which take strings and return sets of tokens, we define a tokenizer to be something which takes in a SGML stream and returns a SGML stream which has been marked up for tokens." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:187	Firstly, there is no direct tie to the process which actually performed the markup; provided a tokenizer adds a markup around what it tokenizes, it doesn't matter whether it is written in C or LISP, or whether it is based on a FSA or a neural net." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:187	Some tokenization can even be done by hand, and any downline application which uses tokenization is completely functionally isolated from the processes used to perform the tokenization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:187	Secondly, each part of the process has a well-defined image at the data level, and a data-level semantics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:187	Thus a tokenizer as part of a complex task has its own semantics, and furthermore its own image in the data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:187	3 Queries and Views SGML markup (Goldfarb, 1990) represents a document in terms of embedded elements akin to a file structure with directories, subdirectories and files." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:187	Thus in the example in Figure 1, the document comprises a header and a body text and these might require different strategies for processing 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:187	The SGML-handling API in our workbench is realized by means of the LT NSL library (Thompson et al. , 1996) which can handle even the most complex document structures (DTDs)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:187	It allows a tool to read, change or add attribute values and character data to SGML elements and address a particular element in a normalized 2 SGML (NSGML) stream using its partial description by means of nsl-queries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:187	Consider the sample text shown in Figure 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:187	Given that text and its markup, we can refer to the second sentence under a BODY element which is under a DOC element: /DOC/BODY/S\[n=2\]." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:187	This will sequentially give us the second sentences in all BODYs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:187	If we want to address only the sentence under the first BODY we can specify that in the query: /DOC/BODY\[0\]/S\[n=2\]." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:187	We can use wildcards in the queries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:187	For instance, the query . */S says 'give me all sentences anywhere in the document' and the wildcard '.*' means ' at any level of embedding'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:187	Thus we can directly specify which parts of the stream we want to process and which to skip." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:187	Using nsl-queries we can access required SGML elements in a document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:187	These elements can have, however, quite complex internal structures which we might want to represent in a number of different ways according to a task at hand." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:187	For instance, if we want to count words in the corpus and these words are marked with their parts of speech and base forms such as <W pos=VBD l=look>looked</W> we should be able to specify to a counting program which fields of the element it should consider." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:187	We might be interested in counting only word-tokens themselves and in this case two wordtokens 'looked' will be counted as one regardless whether they were past verbs or participles." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="8:169	In this paper, we classify collocations into two types according to their structures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:169	One is an uninterrupted collocation which consists of a sequence of words, the other is an interrupted collocation which consists of words containing one or several gaps filled in by substitutable words or phrases which belong to the same category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:169	The features of collocations are defined as follows:  collocations are recurrent  collocations consist of one or several lexical units  order of units are rigid in a collocation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:169	For language processing such as machine translation, a knowledge of domain specific collocations is indispensable because what collocations mean are different from their literal meaning and the usage and meaning of a collocation is totally dependent on each domain." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:166	There are two reasons for this that I will discuss briefly here." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="11:166	The head of the NP (book) has a number of systematically related senses that are being expressed simultaneously." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:166	The meaning of book in this sentence cannot be disambiguated between the number of interpretations that are implied: the informational content of the book (military technicalities), its physical appearance (heavily weighted) and the events that are involved in its construction and use (long)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:166	The example illustrates the fact that disambiguation between related senses is not always possible, which leads to the further question if a discrete distinction between such senses is desirable at all." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:166	A number of researchers have answered this question negatively (see eg: (Pustejovsky, 1995) (Killgariff, 1992))." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="20:166	It seems therefore useful to underspecify the lexical meaning of 'fast' to a representation that captures this primary semantic aspect and gives a general structure for its combination with other lexical items, both locally (in compositional semantics) and globally (in discourse structure)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:166	Both the multiple reference and the sense enumeration problem show that lexical items mostly have an indefinite number of related but highly discourse dependent interpretations, between which cannot be distinguished by semantic tagging alone." ></td>

	<td class="line n" title="19:161	These methods are more appropriate for retrieving bound compositions, while less appropriate for retrieving free ones." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:161	This is because in free compositions, words are related with each other in a more loose way, which may result in the invalidity of mutual information and other statistical means in distinguishing reasonable compositions from unreasonable ones." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="155:161	If given enough and typical compositions, the result is very promising." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="156:161	So important future work is to get as many typical compositions as possible from dictionaries and corpus as the foundation of our algorithms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="157:161	At present, we focus on the problem of learning compositional frames from the given compositions with a single syntactic structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="158:161	In future, we may take into consideration several structures to cluster words, and use the clusters to construct more complex frames." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="159:161	For example, we may consider both A-N and V-N structures in the meantime, and build the frames for them simultaneously." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="160:161	Now we make use of sample points to estimate appropriate values for the parameters, which seems that we cannot determine very accurate values due to the computational costs with sample points increasing." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="34:157	As the second characteristic, the syntactic role of an antecedent cannot be determined by word order." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:157	This is because Korean is a relatively free word-order language like Japanese, Russian, or Finnish, and also because some arguments of a verb may be frequently omitted." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="64:157	During the extraction of SRPs (Ni,SRj, Irk), we only consider the syntactic relation SRjs determined by 5 types of case particles: nominative (-i//ka//kkeyse), accusative (-ul/lul), and three adverbial (-ey//eynun, se/eyse/eysen n, -lo/ulo/ulo un)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:157	3.2 Conceptual Pattern Extraction 3.2.1 Thesaurus Hierarchy For the purpose of type generalization of norainal words in SRPs, the Kadokawa thesaurus titled New Synonym Dictionary (Ohno and Hamanishi, 1981) is used, which has a four-level hierarchy with about 1,000 semantic classes." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="29:153	This keyword selection is done with a morphological analyzer and a stochastic part-of-speech (POS) tagger for the Korean language (Shin et al. , 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:153	The role of the tagger is to help select the exact morpheme sequence from the multiple candidate sequences generated by the morphological analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:153	This process of employing a morphological analysis and a tagger is crucial for selecting legitimate query words from the topic statements because Korean is an agglutinative language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:153	Without the tagger, all the extraneous candidate keywords generated from the morphological analyzer will have to be entered into the translation process, which in and of itself will generate extraneous words, due to one-to-many mapping in the bilingual dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:153	1.2 Dictionary-Based Query Translation The second stage does the actual query translation based on a dictionary look-up, by applying both word-by-word translation and phrase-level translation." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="34:153	For the correct identification of phrases in a Korean query, it would help to identify the lexical relations and produce statistical information on pairs of words in a text corpus as in Smadja (1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:153	Since the bilingual dictionary lacks some words that are essential for a correct interpretation of the Korean query, it is important to identify unknown words such as foreign words and transliterate them into English strings that need to be matched against an English dictionary (Jeong et al. , 1997)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:153	1.3 Selection of the Correct Translations At the word disambiguation stage, we filter out the extraneous words generated blindly from the dictionary lookup process." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="40:153	More details are described in Section 3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:153	1.4 Query Term Weighting Finally, we apply our query term weighting technique to produce the final target query." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:153	The term weighting scheme basically reflects the degree of associations between the translated terms, and we give a high or low term weighting value according to the degree of mutual association between query terms." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="44:153	The result from the four stages is a set of query terms to be used in a 224 vector-space retrieval model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:153	2 Analysis of Translation Ambiguity Although an easy way to find translations of query terms is to use a bilingual dictionary, this method alone suffers from problems caused by translation ambiguity since there are often oneto-many correspondences in a bilingual dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:153	For example, in a Korean query consisting of three words, ':Z\]-o--~-5~\]-~7\] _Q_~'(ja-dong-cha gong-gi oh-yum) that means air pollution caused by automobiles, each word can be translated into multiple English words when a Korean-English dictionary is used in a straightforward way." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:153	The first word ':Z\]-o-~-5~\]-' (ja-dong-cha) of the query can be translated into English words with semantically similar but different words like 'motorcar', 'automobile', and 'car'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:153	The second word '--~-71' (gong-gi), a homonymous word, can be translated into English words with different meanings: 'air', 'atmosphere', 'empty vessel', and 'bowl'." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="35:178	Domain-independent metrics for identifying significant topics In order to identify significant topics in a document, a significance measure is needed, i.e., a method for determining which concepts in the document are relatively important for a given task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:178	The need to determine the importance of a particular concept within a document is motivated by a range of applications, including information retrieval \[Salton 1989\], 303 automatic determination of authorship \[Mosteller and Wallace 1963\], similarity metrics for cross-document clustering \[Hatzivassiloglou et al. 1999\], automatic indexing \[Hodges et al. 1996\] and input to summarization \[Paice 1990\]." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:178	For example, one of the earlier applications using frequency for identifying significant topics in a document was proposed by \[Luhn 1958\] for use in creating automatic abstracts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:178	For each document, a list of stoplisted stems was created, and ranked by frequency; the most frequent keywords were used to identify significant sentences in the original document." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="40:178	Namely, 'the more often certain words are found in each other's company within a sentence, the more significance may be attributed to each of these words'." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:178	This basic observation, although refined extensively by later summarization techniques (as reviewed in \[Paice 1990\]), relies on the capability of identifying significant concepts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:178	The standard IR technique known as tf*idf \[Salton 1989\] seeks to identify documents relevant to a particular query by relativizing keyword frequency in a document as compared to frequency in a corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:178	This method can be used to locate at least some important concepts in full text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:178	Although it has been effective for information retrieval, for other applications, such as human-oriented indexing, this technique is impractical." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:178	Ambiguity of stems (trad might refer to trader or tradition) and of isolated words (state might be a political entity or a mode of being) means that lists of keywords have not usually been used to represent the content of a document to human beings." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:178	Furthermore, humans have a difficult time processing stems and parts of words out of phrasal context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:178	The technical term (TT) method, another technique for identification of significant terms in text that can be used as index terms was introduced by \[Justeson and Katz 1995\], who developed an algorithm for identifying repeated multi-word phrases such as central processing unit in the computer domain or word sense in the lexical semantic domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:178	This algorithm identifies candidate TTs in a corpus by locating NPs consisting of nouns, adjectives, and sometimes prepositional phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:178	TTs are defined as those NPs, or their subparts, which occur above some frequency threshold in a corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:178	However, as \[Boguraev and Kennedy 1998\] observe, the TT technique may not characterize the full content of documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:178	Indeed, even in a technical document, TTs do not provide adequate coverage of the NPs in a document that contribute to its content, especially since TTs are by definition multi-word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:178	A truly domain-general method should apply to both technical and nontechnical documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:178	The relevant difference between technical and non-technical documents is that in technical documents, many of the topics which are significant to the document as a whole may be also TTs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:178	\[Wacholder 1998\] proposed the method of Head Sorting for identifying significant topics that can be used to represent a source document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:178	HS also uses a frequency measure to provide an approximation of topic significance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:178	However, instead of counting frequency of stems or repetition of word sequences, this method counts frequency of a relatively easily identified grammatical element, heads of simplex noun phrases (SNPs)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:178	For common NPs (NPs whose head is a common noun), an SNP is a maximal NP that includes premodifiers such as determiners and possessives but not post-nominal constituents such as prepositions or relativizers." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:178	For example, the well-known book is an SNP but the well-known book on asteroids includes two SNPs, wellknown book and asteroids." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:178	For proper names, an SNP is a name that refers to a single entity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:178	For example, Museum of the City of New York, the name of an organization, is an SNP even though the organizational name incorporates a city name." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:178	Others, such as \[Church 1988\], have discussed a similar concept, sometimes called simple or base NPs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:178	The HS approach is based on the assumption that nominal elements can be used to convey the gist of a document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:178	SNPs, which are semantically and syntactically coherent, appear to be at a good level of detail for content representation of the document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:178	' 304 SNPs are identified by a system \[Evans 1998; Evans et al. 2000\] which sequentially parses text that has been tagged with part of speech using a finite state machine." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:178	Next, the complete list of SNPs identified in a document is sorted by the head of the phrase, which, at least for English-language common SNPs, is almost always the last word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:178	The intuitive justification for sorting SNPs by head is based on the fundamental linguistic distinction between head and modifier: in general, a head makes a greater contribution to the syntax and semantics of a phrase than does a modifier." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:178	This linguistic insight can be extended to the document level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:178	If, as a practical matter, it is necessary to rank the contribution to a whole document made by the sequence of words constituting an NP, the head should be ranked more highly than other words in the phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:178	This distinction is important in linguistic theory; for example, \[Jackendoff 1977\] discusses the relationship of heads and modifiers in phrase structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:178	It is also important in NLP, where, for example, \[Strzalkowski 1997\] and \[Evans and Zhai 1996\] have used the distinction between heads and modifiers to add query terms to information retrieval systems." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:178	Powerful corpus processing techniques have been developed to measure deviance from an average occurrence or co-occurrence in the corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="83:178	This presented us with a problem: on the one hand, we were concerned about preserving the integrity of the three methods, each of which has their own logic, and at the same time, we were concerned to present lists that were balanced relative to each other." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:178	Toward this end, we made several decisions about presentation of the data: 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:178	Threshold: So that no bias would be unintentionally introduced, we presented subjects with all terms output by each method, up to a specified cut-off poinHowever, using lists of equal length for each method would have necessitated either omitting HSs and KWs or changing the definition of TTs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:178	Therefore we made the following decisions:  For TTs, we included all identified terms;  For HSs, we included all terms whose head occurred more than once in the document; 305." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:178	 For KWs, we included all terms in order of decreasing frequency, up to the point where we observed diminishing quality and where the number of KWs approximated the number of HSs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:178	Order: For the KW and TT approach, order is not significant." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:211	Patrick Schone and Daniel Jurafsky University of Colorado, Boulder CO 80309 {schone, jurafsky}@cs.colorado.edu Abstract We seek a knowledge-free method for inducing multiword units from text corpora for use as machine-readable dictionary headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:211	We provide two major evaluations of nine existing collocation-finders and illustrate the continuing need for improvement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:211	We use Latent Semantic Analysis to make modest gains in performance, but we show the significant challenges encountered in trying this approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:211	1 Introduction A multiword unit (MWU) is a connected collocation: a sequence of neighboring words whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived from the meaning or connotation of its components (Choueka, 1988)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:211	In other words, MWUs are typically non-compositional at some linguistic level." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:211	For example, phonological non-compositionality has been observed (Finke & Weibel, 1997; Gregory, et al, 1999) where words like got [gG3Ct] and to [tu] change phonetically to gotta [gG3CG72G46] when combined." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:211	We have interest in inducing headwords for machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), so our interest is in semantic rather than phonological non-compositionality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:211	As an example of semantic non-compositionality, consider compact disk: one could not deduce that it was a music medium by only considering the semantics of compact and disk. MWUs may also be non-substitutable and/or non-modifiable (Manning and Schtze, 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:211	Nonsubstitutability implies that substituting a word of the MWU with its synonym should no longer convey the same original content: compact disk does not readily imply densely-packed disk. Nonmodifiability, on the other hand, suggests one cannot modify the MWUs structure and still convey the same content: compact disk does not signify disk that is compact. MWU dictionary headwords generally satisfy at least one of these constraints." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:211	For example, a compositional phrase would typically be excluded from a hard-copy dictionary since its constituent words would already be listed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:211	These strategies allow hard-copy dictionaries to remain compact." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:211	As mentioned, we wish to find MWU headwords for machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:211	Although space is not an issue in MRDs, we desire to follow the lexicographic practice of reducing redundancy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:211	As Sproat indicated, 'simply expanding the dictionary to encompass every word one is ever likely to encounter is wrong: it fails to take advantage of regularities' (1992, p. xiii)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:211	Our goal is to identify an automatic, knowledge-free algorithm that finds all and only those collocations where it is necessary to supply a definition." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:211	Knowledge-free means that the process should proceed without human input (other than, perhaps, indicating whitespace and punctuation)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:211	This seems like a solved problem." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:211	Many collocation-finders exist, so one might suspect that most could suffice for finding MWU dictionary headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:211	To verify this, we evaluate nine existing collocation-finders to see which best identifies valid headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:211	We evaluate using two completely separate gold standards: (1) WordNet and (2) a compendium of Internet dictionaries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:211	Although web-based resources are dynamic and have better coverage than WordNet (especially for acronyms and names), we show that WordNet-based scores are comparable to those using Internet MRDs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:211	Yet the evaluations indicate that significant improvement is still needed in MWU-induction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:211	As an attempt to improve MWU headword induction, we introduce several algorithms using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:211	LSA is a technique which automatically induces semantic relationships between words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="26:211	We use LSA to try to eliminate proposed MWUs which are semantically compositional." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:211	Unfortunately, this does not help." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:211	Yet when we use LSA to identify substitutable delimiters." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:211	This suggests that in a language with MWUs, we do show modest performance gains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:211	whitespace, one might prefer to begin at the word 2 Previous Approaches For decades, researchers have explored various techniques for identifying interesting collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:211	There have essentially been three separate kinds of approaches for accomplishing this task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:211	These approaches could be broadly classified into (1) segmentation-based, (2) word-based and knowledgedriven, or (3) word-based and probabilistic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:211	We will illustrate strategies that have been attempted in each of the approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:211	Since we assume knowledge of whitespace, and since many of the first and all of the second categories rely upon human input, we will be most interested in the third category." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:211	2.1 Segmentation-driven Strategies Some researchers view MWU-finding as a natural by-product of segmentation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:211	One can regard text as a stream of symbols and segmentation as a means of placing delimiters in that stream so as to separate logical groupings of symbols from one another." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:211	A segmentation process may find that a symbol stream should not be delimited even though subcomponents of the stream have been seen elsewhere." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:211	In such cases, these larger units may be MWUs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:211	The principal work on segmentation has focused either on identifying words in phonetic streams (Saffran, et." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:211	al, 1996; Brent, 1996; de Marcken, 1996) or on tokenizing Asian and Indian languages that do not normally include word delimiters in their orthography (Sproat, et al, 1996; Ponte and Croft 1996; Shimohata, 1997; Teahan, et al. , 2000; and many others)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:211	Such efforts have employed various strategies for segmentation, including the use of hidden Markov models, minimum description length, dictionary-based approaches, probabilistic automata, transformation-based learning, and text compression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:211	Some of these approaches require significant sources of human knowledge, though others, especially those that follow data compression or HMM schemes, do not." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:211	These approaches could be applied to languages where word delimiters exist (such as in European languages delimited by the space character)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:211	However, in such languages, it seems more prudent to simply take advantage of delimiters rather than introducing potential errors by trying to find word boundaries while ignoring knowledge of the level and identify appropriate word combinations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:211	2.2 Word-based, knowledge-driven Strategies Some researchers start with words and propose MWU induction methods that make use of parts of speech, lexicons, syntax or other linguistic structure (Justeson and Katz, 1995; Jacquemin, et al. , 1997; Daille, 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:211	For example, Justeson and Katz indicated that the patterns NOUN NOUN and ADJ NOUN are very typical of MWUs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:211	Daille also suggests that in French, technical MWUs follow patterns such as NOUN de NOUN' (1996, p. 50)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:211	To find word combinations that satisfy such patterns in both of these situations necessitates the use of a lexicon equipped with part of speech tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:211	Since we are interested in knowledge-free induction of MWUs, these approaches are less directly related to our work." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:211	Furthermore, we are not really interested in identifying constructs such as general noun phrases as the above rules might generate, but rather, in finding only those collocations that one would typically need to define." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:211	2.3 Word-based, Probabilistic Approaches The third category assumes at most whitespace and punctuation knowledge and attempts to infer MWUs using word combination probabilities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:211	Table 1 (see next page) shows nine commonly-used probabilistic MWU-induction approaches." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:211	In the table, f and P signify frequency and probability XX of a word X. A variable XY indicates a word bigram and indicates its expected frequency at random." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:211	XY An overbar signifies a variables complement." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:211	For more details, one can consult the original sources as well as Ferreira and Pereira (1999) and Manning and Schtze (1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:211	3 Lexical Access Prior to applying the algorithms, we lemmatize using a weakly-informed tokenizer that knows only that whitespace and punctuation separate words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:211	Punctuation can either be discarded or treated as words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:211	Since we are equally interested in finding units like Dr. and U. S., we opt to treat punctuation as words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:211	Once we tokenize, we use Churchs (1995) suffix array approach to identify word n-grams that occur at least T times (for T=10)." ></td>

	<td class="line oc" title="61:211	Since we need knowledge-poor Daille, 1996) induction, we cannot use human-suggested filtering Chi-squared (G24 ) 2 (Church and Gale, 1991) Z-Score (Smadja, 1993; Fontenelle, et al. , 1994) Students t-Score (Church and Hanks, 1990) n-gram list in accordance to each probabilistic algorithm." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:211	This task is non-trivial since most algorithms were originally suited for finding twoword collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:211	We must therefore decide how to expand the algorithms to identify general n-grams (say, C=w ww )." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:211	We can either generalize or 12 n approximate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:211	Since generalizing requires exponential compute time and memory for several of the algorithms, approximation is an attractive alternative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:211	One approximation redefines X and Y to be, respectively, the word sequences www and 12 i www where i is chosen to maximize P P . i+1 i+2 n, X Y This has a natural interpretation of being the expected probability of concatenating the two most probable substrings in order to form the larger unit." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:211	Since it can be computed rapidly with low memory costs, we use this approximation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:211	Two additional issues need addressing before evaluation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:211	The first regards document sourcing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:211	If an n-gram appears in multiple sources (eg., Congressional Record versus Associated Press), its likelihood of accuracy should increase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:211	This is particularly true if we are looking for MWU headwords for a general versus specialized dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:211	Phrases that appear in one source may in fact be general MWUs, but frequently, they are text-specific units." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:211	Hence, precision gained by excluding single-source n-grams may be worth losses in recall." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:211	We will measure this trade-off." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:211	Second, evaluating with punctuation as words and applying no filtering mechanism may unfairly bias against some algorithms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:211	Preor post-processing of n-grams with a linguistic filter has shown to improve some induction algorithms performance rules as in Section 2.2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:211	Yet we can filter by pruning n-grams whose beginning or ending word is among the top N most frequent words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:211	This unfortunately eliminates acronyms like U. S. and phrasal verbs like throw up. However, discarding some words may be worthwhile if the final list of n-grams is richer in terms of MRD headwords." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:211	We therefore evaluate with such an automatic filter, arbitrarily (and without optimization) choosing N=75." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:211	4 Evaluating Performance A natural scoring standard is to select a language and evaluate against headwords from existing dictionaries in that language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:211	Others have used similar standards (Daille, 1996), but to our knowledge, none to the extent described here." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:211	We evaluate thousands of hypothesized units from an unconstrained corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="7:177	It turns out that for both tasks the performance of the statistical system is comparable to the performance of human subjects." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:177	1 Introduction According to Ferdinand de Saussure (1916), there are two fundamental types of relations between words that he believes correspond to basic operations of our brain: syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:177	There is a syntagmatic relation between two words if they co-occur in spoken or written language more frequently than expected from chance and if they have different grammatical roles in the sentences in which they occur." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:177	Typical examples are the word pairs coffee drink, sun hot, or teacher school." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:177	The relation between two words is paradigmatic if the two words can substitute for one another in a sentence without affecting the grammaticality or acceptability of the sentence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:177	Typical examples are synonyms or antonyms like quick fast, or eat drink." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:177	Normally, words with a paradigmatic relation are the same part of speech, whereas words with a syntagmatic relation can but need not be the same part of speech." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:177	In this paper we want to show that the two types of relations as defined by de Saussure are reflected in the statistical distribution of words in large corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:177	We present algorithms that automatically retrieve words with either the syntagmatic or the paradigmatic type of relationship from corpora and perform a quantitative evaluation of our results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:177	2 Paradigmatic Associations Paradigmatic associations are words with high semantic similarity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:177	According to Ruge (1992), the semantic similarity of two words can be computed by determining the agreement of their lexical neighborhoods." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:177	For example, the semantic similarity of the words red and blue can be derived from the fact that they both frequently co-occur with words like color, flower, dress, car, dark, bright, beautiful, and so forth." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:177	If for each word in a corpus a cooccurrence vector is determined whose entries are the co-occurrences with all other words in the corpus, then the semantic similarities between words can be computed by conducting simple vector comparisons." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:177	To determine the words most similar to a given word, its co-occurrence vector is compared to the co-occurrence vectors of all other words using one of the standard similarity measures, for example, the cosine coefficient." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="22:177	Practical implementations of algorithms based on this principle have led to excellent results as documented in papers by Ruge (1992), Grefenstette (1994), Agarwal (1995), Landauer & Dumais (1997), Schtze (1997), and Lin (1998)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="28:177	The data comprises 80 test items." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:177	Each item consists of a problem word in testing parlance and four alternative words, from which the test taker is asked to choose that with the most similar meaning to the problem word." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="38:177	2.3 Co-occurrence Counting For counting word co-occurrences, as in most other studies a fixed window size is chosen and it is determined how often each pair of words occurs within a text window of this size." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="2:169	We initially propose three basic methods, based on tagger output, chunker output and a chunk grammar, respectively, with the chunk grammar method optionally combining with an attachment resolution module to determine the syntactic structure of verbpreposition pairs in ambiguous constructs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="3:169	We then combine the three methods together into a single classifler, and add in a number of extra lexical and frequentistic features, producing a flnal F-score of 0.865 over the WSJ." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:169	1 Introduction There is growing awareness of the pervasiveness and idiosyncrasy of multiword expressions (MWEs), and the need for a robust, structured handling thereof (Sag et al. , 2002; Calzolari et al. , 2002; Copestake et al. , 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:169	Examples of MWEs are lexically flxed expressions (e.g. ad hoc), idioms (e.g. see double), light verb constructions (e.g. make a mistake) and institutionalised phrases (e.g. kindle excitement)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:169	MWEs pose a challenge to NLP due to their syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies, which are often unpredictable from their component parts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:169	Largescale manual annotation of MWEs is infeasible due to their sheer volume (at least equivalent to the number of simplex words (Jackendofi, 1997)), productivity and domain-speciflcity." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:169	Ideally, therefore, we would like to have some means of automatically extracting MWEs from a given domain or corpus, allowing us to pre-tune our grammar prior to deployment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:169	It is this task of extraction that we target in this paper." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:169	This research represents a component of the LinGO multiword expression project,1 which is targeted at extracting, adequately handling and representing MWEs of all types." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:169	As a research testbed and target resource to expand/domain-tune, we use the LinGO English Resource Grammar (LinGOERG), a linguistically-precise HPSG-based grammar under development at CSLI (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000; Flickinger, 2000)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:169	The particular MWE type we target for extraction is the English verb-particle construction." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:169	Verb-particle constructions (\VPCs') consist of a 1http://lingo.stanford.edu/mwe head verb and one or more obligatory particles, in the form of intransitive prepositions (e.g. hand in), adjectives (e.g. cut short) or verbs (e.g. let go) (Villavicencio and Copestake, 2002a; Villavicencio and Copestake, 2002b; Huddleston and Pullum, 2002); for the purposes of this paper, we will focus exclusively on prepositional particles|by far the most common and productive of the three types| and further restrict our attention to single-particle VPCs (i.e. we ignore VPCs such as get along together)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:169	We deflne VPCs to optionally select for an NP complement, i.e. to occur both transitively (e.g. hand in the paper) and intransitively (e.g. battle on)." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="15:169	One aspect of VPCs that makes them dicult to extract (cited in, e.g., Smadja (1993)) is that the verb and particle can be non-contiguous, e.g. hand the paper in and battle right on." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:169	This sets them apart from conventional collocations and terminology (see, e.g., Manning and Schutze (1999) and McKeown and Radev (2000)) in that they cannot be captured effectively using N-grams, due to the variability in the number and type of words potentially interceding between the verb and particle." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:169	We are aiming for an extraction technique which is applicable to any raw text corpus, allowing us to tune grammars to novel domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:169	Any linguistic annotation required during the extraction process, therefore, is produced through automatic means, and it is only for reasons of accessibility and comparability with other research that we choose to work over the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:169	That is, other than in establishing upper bounds on the performance of the difierent extraction methods, we use only the raw text component of the treebank." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="21:169	We then present and evaluate a number of simple methods for extracting VPCs based on, respectively, POS tagging (x 3), the output of a full text chunk parser (x 4), and a chunk grammar (x 5)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:169	Finally, we detail enhancements to the basic methods (x 6) and give a brief description of related research (x 7) before concluding the paper (x 8)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="27:169	If the preposition is transitive, it must select for an NP, producing either a prepositional verb (e.g. refer to) or a free verbpreposition combination (e.g. put it on the table, climb up the ladder)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="28:169	A number of diagnostics can be used to distinguish VPCs from both prepositional verbs and free verb preposition combinations (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002): 1." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:169	transitive VPCs undergo the particle alternation 2." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="31:169	manner adverbs cannot occur between the verb and particle The flrst two diagnostics are restricted to transitive VPCs, while the third applies to both intransitive and transitive VPCs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:169	The flrst diagnostic is the canonical test for particlehood, and states that transitive VPCs take two word orders: the joined conflguration whereby the verb and particle are adjacent and the NP complement follows the particle (e.g. hand in the paper), and the split conflguration whereby the NP complement occurs between the verb and particle (e.g. hand the paper in)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="33:169	Note that prepositional verbs and free verbpreposition combinations can occur only in the joined conflguration (e.g. refer to the book vs. *refer the book to)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:169	Therefore, the existence of a verbpreposition pair in the split conflguration is sucient evidence for a VPC analysis." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:169	It is important to realise that compatibility with the particle alternation is a sucient but not necessary condition on verbparticlehood." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:169	That is, a small number of VPCs do not readily occur in the split conflguration, including carry out (a threat) (cf.?carry a threat out)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:169	The second diagnostic stipulates that pronominal NPs can occur only in the split conflguration (hand it in vs. *hand in it)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:169	Note also that heavy NPs tend to occur in the joined conflguration, and that various other factors interact to determine which conflguration a given VPC in context will occur in (see, e.g., Gries (2000))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:169	The third diagnostic states that manner adverbs cannot intercede between the verb and particle (e.g. *hand quickly the paper in)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:169	Note that this constraint is restricted to manner adverbs, and that there is a small set of adverbs which can pre-modify particles and hence occur between the verb and particle (e.g. well in jump well up)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="45:169	Figure 1 indicates the relative proportion of the 62 attested VPC types which occur with the indicated frequencies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:169	From this, it is apparent that two-thirds of VPCs occur at most three times in the overall corpus, meaning that any extraction method must be able to handle extremely sparse data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:169	Of the 62 attested VPCs, 29 have intransitive usages and 45 have transitive usages." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:169	Of the 45 attested transitive VPCs, 12 occur in both the joined and split conflgurations and can hence be unambiguously identifled as VPCs based on the flrst diagnostic from above." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:169	For the remaining 33 transitive VPCs, we have only the joined usage, and must flnd some alternate means of ruling out a prepositional verb or free verbpreposition combination analysis." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="52:169	That is, recall is an indication of the proportion of the 62 VPCs contained within the set of extracted VPCs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:169	3 Method-1: Simple POS-based Extraction One obvious method for extracting VPCs is to run a simple regular expression over the output of a partof-speech (POS) tagger, based on the observation that the Penn Treebank POS tagset, e.g., contains a dedicated particle tag (RP)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:169	Given that all particles are governed by a verb, extraction consists of simply locating each particle and searching back (to the left of the particle, as particles cannot be passivised or otherwise extraposed) for the head verb of the VPC." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:169	Here and for the subsequent methods, we assume that the maximum word length for NP complements in the split conflguration for transitive VPCs is 5,2 i.e. that an NP \heavier' than this would occur more naturally in the joined conflguration." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:169	We thus discount all particles which are more than 5 words from their governing verb." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:169	Additionally, we extracted a set of 73 canonical particles from the LinGO-ERG, and used this to fllter out extraneous particles in the POS data." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:169	In line with our assumption of raw text to extract over, we use the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) to automatically tag the WSJ, rather than making use of the manual POS annotation provided in the Penn Treebank." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:169	We further lemmatise the data using morph (Minnen et al. , 2001) and extract VPCs based on the Brill tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:169	This produces a total of 135 VPCs, which we evaluate according to the standard metrics of precision (Prec), recall (Rec) and F-score (Ffl=1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:169	Note that here and for the remainder of this paper, precision is calculated according to the manual annotation for the combined total of 4,173 VPC candidate types extracted by the various methods described in this paper, whereas recall is relative to the 62 attested VPCs from the Alvey Tools data as described above." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:169	As indicated in the flrst line of Table 1 (\Brill'), the simple POS-based method results in a precision of 1.000, recall of 0.177 and F-score of 0.301." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="64:169	This resulted in an F-score of 0.774 (\Penn' in Table 1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:169	The primary reason for the large disparity between the Brill tagger output and original Penn Treebank annotation is that it is notoriously dicult to difierentiate between particles, prepositions and adverbs (Toutanova and Manning, 2000)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:108	The cut-off point we finally used is 50%, i.e. a pair+relation will be kept in our knowledge base if the probability obtained this way is more than 50%." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:108	This may seem low, but it is higher than we think considering the fact that verb-object and modifier-head are not the only relations that can hold between a verb and a noun." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="5:202	The system has been tested on the Brown Corpus leading to encouraging results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:202	1 Introduction Multiword units (MWUs) include a large range of linguistic phenomena, such as compound nouns (e.g. interior designer), phrasal verbs (e.g. run through), adverbial locutions (e.g. on purpose), compound determinants (e.g. an amount of), prepositional locutions (e.g. in front of) and institutionalized phrases (e.g. con carne)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:202	MWUs are frequently used in everyday language, usually to precisely express ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:202	As a consequence, their identification is a crucial issue for applications that require some degree of semantic processing (e.g. machine translation, summarization, information retrieval)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:202	In recent years, there has been a growing awareness in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community of the problems that MWUs pose and the need for their robust handling." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="10:202	For that purpose, syntactical (Didier Bourigault, 1993), statistical (Frank Smadja, 1993; Ted Dunning, 1993; Gal Dias, 2002) and hybrid syntaxicostatistical methodologies (Batrice Daille, 1996; JeanPhilippe Goldman et al. 2001) have been proposed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:202	In this paper, we propose an original hybrid system called HELAS 1 that extracts MWU candidates from part-of-speech tagged corpora." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:202	Unlike classical hybrid systems that manually pre-define local part-of-speech patterns of interest (Batrice Daille, 1996; Jean-Philippe Goldman et al. 2001), our solution automatically identifies relevant syntactical patterns from the corpus." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:202	Word statistics are then combined with the endogenously acquired linguistic information in order to extract the most relevant sequences of words i.e. MWU candidates." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:202	Technically, we conjugate the Mutual Expectation (ME) association measure with the acquisition process called GenLocalMaxs (Gal Dias, 2002) in a five step process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:202	First, the part-of-speech tagged corpus is divided into two sub-corpora: one containing words and one containing part-of-speech tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:202	Each sub-corpus is then segmented into a set of positional ngrams i.e. ordered vectors of textual units." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:202	Third, the ME independently evaluates the degree of cohesiveness of each positional ngram i.e. any positional ngram of words and any positional ngram of part-of-speech tags." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:202	A combination of both MEs is then used to evaluate the global degree of cohesiveness of any sequence of words associated with its respective part-of-speech tag sequence." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="28:202	2 Related Work For the purpose of MWU extraction, syntactical, statistical and hybrid syntaxico-statistical methodologies have been proposed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="29:202	On one hand, purely linguistic systems (Didier Bourigault, 1993) propose to extract relevant MWUs by using techniques that analyse specific syntactical structures in the texts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="30:202	However, these methodologies suffer from their monolingual basis as the systems require highly specialised linguistic techniques to identify clues that isolate possible MWU candidates." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="31:202	On the other hand, purely statistical systems (Frank Smadja, 1993; Ted Dunning, 1993; Gal Dias, 2002) extract discriminating MWUs from text corpora by means of association measure regularities." ></td>
	<td class="line p" title="32:202	As they use plain text corpora and only require the information appearing in texts, such systems are highly flexible and extract relevant units independently from the domain and the language of the input text." ></td>
	<td class="line n" title="33:202	However, these methodologies can only identify textual associations in the context of their usage." ></td>
	<td class="line n" title="34:202	As a consequence, many relevant structures can not be introduced directly into lexical databases as they do not guarantee adequate linguistic structures for that purpose." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:202	Finally, hybrid syntactico-statistical systems (Batrice Daille, 1996; Jean-Philippe Goldman et al. 2001) define co-occurrences of interest in terms of syntactical patterns and statistical regularities." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:202	Thus, such systems reduce the searching space to groups of words that correspond to a priori defined syntactical patterns (e.g. Adj+Noun, Noun+Prep+Noun) and apply statistical scores to identify the most relevant sequences of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:202	One major drawback of such systems is that they do not deal with a great proportion of interesting MWUs (e.g. phrasal verbs, prepositional locutions)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:202	Moreover, they lack flexibility as the syntactical patterns have to be revised whenever the targeted language changes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:202	In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an original architecture that combines word statistics with endogenously acquired linguistic information." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:202	We base our study on two assumptions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:202	On one hand, a great deal of studies in lexicography and terminology assess that most of the MWUs evidence well-known morphosyntactic structures (Gaston Gross, 1996)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:202	On the other hand, MWUs are recurrent combinations of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:202	Indeed, according to Benot Habert and Christian Jacquemin (1993), the MWUs may represent a fifth of the overall surface of a text." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:202	Consequently, it is reasonable to think that the syntactical patterns embodied by the MWUs may be endogenously identified by using statistical scores over texts of part-of-speech tags exactly in the same manner as word dependencies are identified in corpora of words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:202	So, the global degree of cohesiveness of any sequence of words may be evaluated by a combination of its degree of cohesiveness of words and the degree of cohesiveness of its associated part-of-speech tag sequence (See Figure 1)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:202	Compared to existing systems, the benefits of our architecture are clear." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:202	By avoiding human intervention in the definition of syntactical patterns, (1) HELAS provides total flexibility of use being independent of the targeted Input Tagged Text Text of Words Text of Tags Word ngrams Tag ngrams ME (word ngram) ME (word ngram)  x ME (tag ngram) 1 ME (tag ngram) GenLocalMaxs MWU candidates language and (2) it allows the identification of various MWUs like phrasal verbs, adverbial locutions, compound determinants, prepositional locutions and institutionalized phrases." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="49:202	3.1 Positional Ngrams The original idea of the positional ngram model (Gal Dias, 2002) comes from the lexicographic evidence that most lexical relations associate words separated by at most five other words (John Sinclair, 1974)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:202	As a consequence, lexical relations such as MWUs can be continuous or discontinuous sequences of words in a context of at most eleven words (i.e. 5 words to the left of a pivot word, 5 words to the right of the same pivot word and the pivot word itself)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:202	In general terms, a MWU can be defined as a specific continuous or discontinuous sequence of words in a (2.F+1)-word size window context (i.e. F words to the left of a pivot word, F words to the right of the same pivot word and the pivot word itself)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="45:167	However, lo egin and lan egin can be considered 'syntactically idiomatic' since the nouns in these expressions, lo and lan, take no determiner, which would be completely ungrammatical for a noun functioning as a regular direct object (*arroz jan nuen 'I ate rice')." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="48:167	'did you sleep at all last night?'); besides, the components of the construction may change positions and some elements and phrases may be placed between them (mendian egin omen zuen lasai lo 'it is said that he slept peacefully in the mountain')." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="91:204	Those values are later combined to form a single RSV per document." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:204	4.1 Definition and Extraction Technique MFS are sequences of words that are frequent in the document collection and, moreover, that are not contained in any other longer frequent sequence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:204	Given a frequency threshold , a sequence is considered to be frequent if it appears in at least  documents." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="95:204	This is a necessity, since maximal frequent sequences in documents may be rather long." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:204	Nevertheless, when we tried to extract the maximal frequent sequences from the collection of documents, their number and the total number of word features in the collection did pose a clear computational problem and did not actually permit to obtain any result." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="99:204	We conjecture that more consistent subcollections permit to obtain a better approximation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:204	This is due to the fact that maximal frequent sequences are formed from similar text fragments." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:204	Accordingly, we formed the subcollection by clustering similar documents together using the well-known k-means algorithm (see for example Willett (1988) or Doucet and AhonenMyka (2002))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:204	4.2 Main Strengths of the Maximal Frequent Sequences The method efficiently extracts all the maximal frequent word sequences from the collection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:204	From the definitions above, a sequence is said to be maximal if and only if no other frequent sequence contains that sequence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:204	Furthermore, a gap between words is allowed: in a sentence, the words do not have to appear continuously." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:204	A parameter g tells how many other words two words in a sequence can have between them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:204	The parameter g usually gets values between 1 and 3." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:204	For instance, if g = 2, a phrase President Bush will be found in both of the following text fragments:President of the United States Bush President George W. Bush Note: Articles, prepositions and small words were pruned away during the preprocessing." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:204	This allowance of gaps between words of a sequence is probably the strongest specificity of the method, compared to most existing methods for extracting text descriptors." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:204	This greatly increases the quality of the phrase, since processing takes the variety of natural language into account." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="110:204	The other powerful specificity of the technique is the ability to extract maximal frequent sequences of any length." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="111:204	This permits to obtain a very compact description of documents." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="112:204	For example, by restricting the length of phrases to 8, the presence, in the document collection, of a frequent phrase of 25 words would result in thousands of phrases representing the same knowledge as this one maximal sequence." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="113:204	The result of this extraction is that each document of the collection is described by a (possibly empty) set of MFS." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="117:204	5.1 Word features RSV The vector space model offers a very convenient framework for computing similarities between documents and queries." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="121:204	5.2 MFS RSV The first step is to create an MFS index for the document collection." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="122:204	Once a set of maximal frequent sequences has been extracted and each document is attached to the corresponding phrases, as detailed in the previous section, it remains to define the procedure to match a phrase describing a document and a keyphrase (from a query)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="123:204	Note that from here onwards, keyphrase denotes a phrase found in a query, and maximal sequence denotes a phrase extracted from a document." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="128:204	5.2.1 Definitions: Let D be a collection of N documents and A1 Am a keyphrase of size m. Let Ai and Aj be 2 words of A1 Am occurring in this order, and n be the number of documents of the collection in which AiAj was found." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="144:204	However, this would not be satisfying, because the least frequent words are all missed by the algorithm for MFS extraction." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="3:157	Evaluation of this measure, the mutual rank ratio metric, shows that it produces better results than standard statistical measures when applied to this task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="4:157	1 Introduction The ordinary vocabulary of a language like English contains thousands of phrasal terms -multiword lexical units including compound nouns, technical terms, idioms, and fixed collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:157	The exact number of phrasal terms is difficult to determine, as new ones are coined regularly, and it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a phrase is a fixed term or a regular, compositional expression." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:157	Accurate identification of phrasal terms is important in a variety of contexts, including natural language parsing, question answering systems, information retrieval systems, among others." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:157	Insofar as phrasal terms function as lexical units, their component words tend to cooccur more often, to resist substitution or paraphrase, to follow fixed syntactic patterns, and to display some degree of semantic noncompositionality (Manning, 1999:183-186)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:157	However, none of these characteristics are amenable to a simple algorithmic interpretation." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="9:157	It is true that various term extraction systems have been developed, such as Xtract (Smadja 1993), Termight (Dagan & Church 1994), and TERMS (Justeson & Katz 1995) among others (cf.Daille 1996, Jacquemin & Tzoukermann 1994, Jacquemin, Klavans, & Toukermann 1997, Boguraev & Kennedy 1999, Lin 2001)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="12:157	Grammatical patterns, such as adjective-noun or noun-noun sequences are selected then ranked statistically, and the resulting ranked list is either used directly or submitted for manual filtering." ></td>
	<td class="line o" title="13:157	The linguistic filters used in typical term extraction systems have no obvious connection with the criteria that linguists would argue define a phrasal term (noncompositionality, fixed order, nonsubstitutability, etc.)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="17:157	Several studies of the performance of lexical association metrics suggest significant room for improvement, but also variability among tasks." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:157	One series of studies (Krenn 1998, 2000; Evert & Krenn 2001, Krenn & Evert 2001; also see Evert 2004) focused on the use of association metrics to identify the best candidates in particular grammatical constructions, such as adjective-noun pairs or verb plus prepositional phrase constructions, and compared the performance of simple frequency to several common measures (the log-likelihood, the t-test, the chi-squared test, the dice coefficient, relative entropy and mutual information)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:157	In Krenn & Evert 2001, frequency outperformed mutual information though not the ttest, while in Evert and Krenn 2001, log-likelihood and the t-test gave the best results, and mutual information again performed worse than frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:157	However, in all these studies performance was generally low, with precision falling rapidly after the very highest ranked phrases in the list." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:157	By contrast, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) evaluate the identification of phrasal terms without grammatical filtering on a 6.7 million word extract from the TREC databases, applying both WordNet and online dictionaries as gold standards." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:157	Once again, the general level of performance was low, with precision falling off rapidly as larger portions 605 of the n-best list were included, but they report better performance with statistical and information theoretic measures (including mutual information) than with frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="23:157	The overall pattern appears to be one where lexical association measures in general have very low precision and recall on unfiltered data, but perform far better when combined with other features which select linguistic patterns likely to function as phrasal terms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:157	The relatively low precision of lexical association measures on unfiltered data no doubt has multiple explanations, but a logical candidate is the failure or inappropriacy of underlying statistical assumptions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="25:157	For instance, many of the tests assume a normal distribution, despite the highly skewed nature of natural language frequency distributions, though this is not the most important consideration except at very low n (cf.Moore 2004, Evert 2004, ch." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="27:157	4)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="30:157	Use of linguistic filters such as 'attributive adjective followed by noun' or 'verb plus modifying prepositional phrase' arguably has the effect of selecting a subset of the language for which the standard null hypothesis -that any word may freely be combined with any other word -may be much more accurate." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="31:157	Additionally, many of the association measures are defined only for bigrams, and do not generalize well to phrasal terms of varying length." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="35:157	Section 3 will present the data sources and evaluation methodologies applied in the rest of the paper." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="36:157	Section 4 will evaluate the mutual rank ratio statistic and several other lexical association measures on a larger corpus than has been used in previous evaluations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="37:157	As will be shown below, the mutual rank ratio statistic recognizes phrasal terms more effectively than standard statistical measures." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:157	2 Statistical considerations 2.1 Highly skewed distributions As first observed e.g. by Zipf (1935, 1949) the frequency of words and other linguistic units tend to follow highly skewed distributions in which there are a large number of rare events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:157	Zipf's formulation of this relationship for single word frequency distributions (Zipf's first law) postulates that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency distribution, or more generally if we rank words by frequency and assign rank z, where the function fz(z,N) gives the frequency of rank z for a sample of size N, Zipf's first law states that: fz(z,N) = Cz where C is a normalizing constant and is a free parameter that determines the exact degree of skew; typically with single word frequency data, approximates 1 (Baayen 2001: 14)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:157	Ideally, an association metric would be designed to maximize its statistical validity with respect to the distribution which underlies natural language text -which is if not a pure Zipfian distribution at least an LNRE (large number of rare events, cf.Baayen 2001) distribution with a very long tail, containing events which differ in probability by many orders of magnitude." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:157	Unfortunately, research on LNRE distributions focuses primarily on unigram distributions, and generalizations to bigram and ngram distributions on large corpora are not as yet clearly feasible (Baayen 2001:221)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:157	Yet many of the best-performing lexical association measures, such as the t-test, assume normal distributions, (cf.Dunning 1993) or else (as with mutual information) eschew significance testing in favor of a generic information-theoretic approach." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:157	Various strategies could be adopted in this situation: finding a better model of the distribution,or adopting a nonparametric method." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:157	2.2 The independence assumption Even more importantly, many of the standard lexical association measures measure significance (or information content) against the default assumption that word-choices are statistically independent events." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:157	This assumption is built into the highest-performing measures as observed in Evert & Krenn 2001, Krenn & Evert 2001 and Schone & Jurafsky 2001." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:157	This is of course untrue, and justifiable only as a simplifying idealization in the absence of a better model." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:157	The actual probability of any sequence of words is strongly influenced by the base grammatical and semantic structure of language, particularly since phrasal terms usually conform to 606 the normal rules of linguistic structure." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="50:157	What makes a compound noun, or a verb-particle construction, into a phrasal term is not deviation from the base grammatical pattern for noun-noun or verb-particle structures, but rather a further pattern (of meaning and usage and thus heightened frequency) superimposed on the normal linguistic base." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:157	There are, of course, entirely aberrant phrasal terms, but they constitute the exception rather than the rule." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:157	This state of affairs poses something of a chicken-and-the-egg problem, in that statistical parsing models have to estimate probabilities from the same base data as the lexical association measures, so the usual heuristic solution as noted above is to impose a linguistic filter on the data, with the association measures being applied only to the subset thus selected." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:157	The result is in effect a constrained statistical model in which the independence assumption is much more accurate." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="63:157	2.4 Mutual expectation An interesting proposal which seeks to overcome the variable-length issue is the mutual expectation metric presented in Dias, Guillor, and Lopes (1999) and implemented in the SENTA system (Gil and Dias 2003a)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:157	In their approach, the frequency of a phrase is normalized by taking into account the relative probability of each word compared to the phrase." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:157	Dias, Guillor, and Lopes take as the foundation of their approach the idea that the cohesiveness of a text unit can be measured by measuring how strongly it resists the loss of any component term." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:157	This is implemented by considering, for any ngram, the set of [continuous or discontinuous] (n-1)-grams which can be formed by deleting one word from the n-gram." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:157	A normalized expectation for the n-gram is then calculated as follows: 1 2 1 2 ([, ]) ([,  ]) n n p w w w FPE w w w where [w1, w2  wn] is the phrase being evaluated and FPE([w1, w2  wn]) is: 1 2 1 1 ^1 ([,  ]) [   ] n n i n i p w w w p w w wn = + where wi is the term omitted from the n-gram." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:157	They then calculate mutual expectation as the product of the probability of the n-gram and its normalized expectation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:157	This statistic is of interest for two reasons: first, it provides a single statistic that can be applied to n-grams of any length; second, it is not based upon the independence assumption." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:157	The core statistic, normalized expectation, is essentially frequency with a penalty if a phrase contains component parts significantly more frequent than the phrase itself." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:157	It is of course an empirical question how well mutual expectation performs (and we shall examine this below) but mutual expectation is not in any sense a significance test." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:157	That is, if we are examining a phrase like the east end, the conditional probability of east given [__ end] or of end given [__ east] may be relatively low (since other words can appear in that context) and yet the phrase might still be very lexicalized if the association of both words with this context were significantly stronger than their association for 607 other phrases." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:157	That is, to the extent that phrasal terms follow the regular patterns of the language, a phrase might have a relatively low conditional probability (given the wide range of alternative phrases following the same basic linguistic patterns) and thus have a low mutual expectation yet still occur far more often than one would expect from chance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:157	In short, the fundamental insight -assessing how tightly each word is bound to a phrase -is worth adopting." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:157	There is, however, good reason to suspect that one could improve on this method by assessing relative statistical significance for each component word without making the independence assumption." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:157	In the heuristic to be outlined below, a nonparametric method is proposed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:157	This method is novel: not a modification of mutual expectation, but a new technique based on ranks in a Zipfian frequency distribution." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:157	2.5 Rank ratios and mutual rank ratios This technique can be justified as follows." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:157	For each component word in the n-gram, we want to know whether the n-gram is more probable for that word than we would expect given its behavior with other words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:157	Since we do not know what the expected shape of this distribution is going to be, a nonparametric method using ranks is in order, and there is some reason to think that frequency rank regardless of n-gram size will be useful." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:157	In particular, Ha, Sicilia-Garcia, Ming and Smith (2002) show that Zipf's law can be extended to the combined frequency distribution of n-grams of varying length up to rank 6, which entails that the relative rank of words in such a combined distribution provide a useful estimate of relative probability." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:157	The availability of new techniques for handling large sets of n-gram data (e.g. Gil & Dias 2003b) make this a relatively feasible task." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:157	Thus, given a phrase like east end, we can rank how often __ end appears with east in comparison to how often other phrases appear with east.That is, if {__ end, __side, the __, toward the __, etc.} is the set of (variable length) n-gram contexts associated with east (up to a length cutoff), then the actual rank of __ end is the rank we calculate by ordering all contexts by the frequency with which the actual word appears in the context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:157	We also rank the set of contexts associated with east by their overall corpus frequency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:157	The resulting ranking is the expected rank of __ end based upon how often the competing contexts appear regardless of which word fills the context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:157	The rank ratio (RR) for the word given the context can then be defined as: RR(word,context) = ( )( ),,ER word contextAR word context where ER is the expected rank and AR is the actual rank." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="88:157	A few notes about the details of the method are in order." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:157	Actual ranks are assigned by listing all the contexts associated with each word in the corpus, and then ranking contexts by word, assigning the most frequent context for word n the rank 1, next next most frequent rank 2, etc. Tied ranks are given the median value for the ranks occupied by the tie, e.g., if two contexts with the same frequency would occupy ranks 2 and 3, they are both assigned rank 2.5." ></td>

This work was extended by Caraballo (1999), who built classes of related words in this fashion and then reasoned that if a hierarchical relationship could be extracted for any member of this class, it could be applied to all members of the class." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="36:148	At the same time, work in analyzing idioms and asymmetry within linguistics has become more sophisticated, as discussed by Benor and Levy (2004), and many of the semantic factors underlying our results can be understood from a sophisticated theoretical perspective." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="45:148	Since the phrase nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves or coriander fits the pattern A, B, C or D, we create nodes for each of these nouns and create links between them all." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="4:209	1 Introduction The term idiom has been applied to a fuzzy category with prototypical examples such as by and large, kick the bucket, and let the cat out of the bag." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="5:209	Providing adefinitive answerforwhatidioms are, and determining how they are learned and understood, are still subject to debate (Glucksberg, 1993; Nunberg et al. , 1994)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:209	Nonetheless, they are often defined as phrases or sentences that involve some degree of lexical, syntactic, and/or semantic idiosyncrasy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:209	Idiomatic expressions, as a part of the vast family of figurative language, are widely used both in colloquial speech and in written language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:209	Moreover, a phrase develops its idiomaticity over time (Cacciari, 1993); consequently, new idioms come into existence on a daily basis (Cowie et al. , 1983; Seaton and Macaulay, 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="9:209	Idioms thus pose a serious challenge, both for the creation of widecoverage computational lexicons, and for the development of large-scale, linguistically plausible natural language processing (NLP) systems (Sag et al. , 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="10:209	One problem is due to the range of syntactic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic expressions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:209	Some idioms, such as by and large, contain syntactic violations; these are often completely fixed and hence can be listed in a lexicon as words with spaces (Sag et al. , 2002)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="12:209	However, among those idioms that are syntactically well-formed, some exhibit limited morphosyntactic flexibility, while others may be more syntactically flexible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:209	For example, theidiom shoot the breezeundergoes verbalinflection(shot the breeze), but not internal modification orpassivization (?shoot the fun breeze, ?the breeze was shot)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:209	In contrast, the idiom spill the beans undergoes verbal inflection, internal modification, and even passivization." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:209	Clearly, a words-withspaces approach does not capture the full range of behaviour of such idiomatic expressions." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:209	Another barrier to the appropriate handling of idioms in a computational system is their semantic idiosyncrasy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:209	This is aparticular issue for those idioms that conform to the grammar rules of the language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:209	Such idiomatic expressions are indistinguishable on the surface from compositional (nonidiomatic) phrases, but a computational system must be capable of distinguishing the two." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:209	For example, a machine translation system should translate the idiom shoot the breeze as a single unit of meaning (to chat), whereas this is not the case for the literal phrase shoot the bird." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:209	In this study, we focus on a particular class of English phrasal idioms, i.e., those that involve the combination of a verb plus a noun in its direct object position." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="21:209	Examples include shoot the breeze, pull strings, and push ones luck." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="22:209	We refer to these as verb+noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="94:160	3.a) Loi modifiant la Loi sur la responsabilite civile 3.b) la loi devrait etre modifiee Parsing helps to create a more realistic frequency profile for the candidate pairs, not only because of the grammaticality constraint it applies on the pairs (wrong pairs are excluded), but also because it can detect the long-distance pairs that are outside the collocational window." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="95:160	Given that the association measures rely heavily on the frequency information, the erroneous counts have a direct influence on the ranking of candidates and, consequently, on the top candidates returned." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:160	We believe that in order to achieve a good performance, extraction systems should be as close as possible to the real frequency counts and, of course, to the real syntactic interpretation provided in the source texts6." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:160	Since parser-based methods rely on more accurate frequency information for words and their cooccurrence than window methods, it follows that the n-best list obtained with the first methods will probably show an increase in quality over the second." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:160	To conclude this section, we enumerate the hypotheses that have been formulated so far: (1) Parse methods provide a noise-freer list of collocation candidates, in comparison with the window methods; (2) Local precision (of best-scored results) with respect to grammaticality is higher for parse methods, since in basic methods some noise still persists, even if more data is included; (3) Local precision with respect to collocability is higher for parse methods, because they use a more realistic image of word co-occurrence frequency." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="103:160	We rather distinguish between lexicalizable and trivial combinations (completely regular productions, such as big house, buy bread, that do not deserve a place in the lexicon)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:160	As in (Choueka, 1988) and (Evert, 2004), we consider that a dominant feature of collocations is that they are unpredictable for speakers and therefore have to be stored into a lexicon." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:160	6To exemplify this point: the pair developpement humain (which has been detected as a collocation by the basic method) looks like a valid expression, but the source text consistently offers a different interpretation: developpement des ressources humaines." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="111:160	In accordance with (Evert and Kermes, 2003), we consider that the comparative evaluation of collocation extraction systems should not be done at the end of the extraction process, but separately for each stage: after the candidate selection stage, for evaluating the quality (in terms of grammaticality) of candidates proposed; and after the application of collocability measures, for evaluating the measures applied." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="57:299	3 Automatic Identification and extraction of Chinese MWEs In order to test the feasibility of automatic identification and extraction of Chinese MWEs on a large scale, we used an existing statistical tool built for English and a Chinese corpus built at CCID." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:299	A CCID tool is used for tokenizing and POS-tagging the Chinese corpus." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="60:299	In this paper, we aim to evaluate this existing tool from two perspectives a) its performance on MWE extraction, and b) its performance on a language other than English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:299	In the following sections, we describe our experiment in detail and discuss main issues that arose during the course of our experiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:299	3.1 MWE extraction tool The tool we used for the experiment exploits statistical collocational information between near-context words (Piao et al. , 2005)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:299	It first collects collocates within a given scanning window, and then searches for MWEs using the collocational information as a statistical dictionary." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:299	As the collocational information can be extracted on the fly from the corpus to be processed for a reasonably large corpus, this process is fully automatic." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:299	To search for MWEs in a small corpus, such as a few sentences, the tool needs to be trained on other corpus data in advance." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="66:299	With regards to the statistical measure of collocation, the option of several formulae are available, including mutual information and log likelihood, etc. Our past experience shows that log-likelihood provides an efficient metric for corpus data of moderate sizes." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="67:299	Therefore it is used in our experiment." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="68:299	It is calculated as follows (Scott, 2001)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="69:299	For a given pair of words X and Y and a search window W, let a be the number of windows in which X and Y co-occur, let b be the number of windows in which only X occurs, let c be the number of windows in which only Y occurs, and let d be the number of windows in which none of them occurs, then G 2 = 2 (alna + blnb + clnc + dlnd (a+b)ln(a+b) (a+c)ln(a+c) (b+d)ln(b+d) (c+d)ln(c+d)) + (a+b+c+d)ln(a+b+c+d)) In addition to the log-likelihood, the t-score is used to filter out insignificant co-occurrence word pairs (Fung and Church, 1994), which is calculated as follows: ),( 1 )()(),( ba baba WWprob M WprobWprobWWprob t  = In order to filter out weak collocates, a threshold is often used, i.e. in the stage of collocation extraction, any pairs of items producing word affinity scores lower than a given threshold are excluded from the MWE searching process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="70:299	Furthermore, in order to avoid the noise caused by functional words and some extremely frequent words, a stop word list is used to filter such words out from the process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="71:299	If the corpus data is POS-tagged, some simple POS patterns can be used to filter certain syntactic patterns from the candidates." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="72:299	It can either be implemented as an internal part of the process, or as a post-process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:299	In our case, such pattern filters are mostly applied to the output of the MWE searching tool in order to allow the tool to be language-independent as much as possible." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="74:299	Consequently, for our experiment, the major adjustment to the tool was to add a Chinese stop word list." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="75:299	Because the tool is based on Unicode, the stop words of different languages can be kept in a single file, avoiding any need for adjusting the program itself." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="76:299	Unless different languages involved happen to share words with the same form, this practice is safe and reliable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="77:299	In our particular case, because we are dealing with English and Chinese, which use widely different characters, such a practice performs well." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="78:299	19 Another language-specific adjustment needed was to use a Chinese POS-pattern filter for selecting various patterns of the candidate MWEs (see Table 6)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="79:299	As pointed out previously, it was implemented as a simple pattern-matching program that is separate from the MWE tool itself, hence minimizing the modification needed for porting the tool from English to Chinese language." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="80:299	A major advantage of this tool is its capability of identifying MWEs of various lengths which are generally representative of the given topic or domain." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="81:299	Furthermore, for English it was found effective in extracting domain-specific multiword terms and expressions which are not included in manually compiled lexicons and dictionaries." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="82:299	Indeed, due to the open-ended nature of such MWEs, any manually compiled lexicons, however large they may be, are unlikely to cover them exhaustively." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="83:299	It is also efficient in finding newly emerging MWEs, particularly technical terms, that reflect the changes in the real world." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="84:299	3.2 Experiment In this experiment, our main aim was to examine the feasibility of practical application of the MWE tool as a component of an MT system, therefore we used test data from some domains in which translation services are in strong demand." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="85:299	We selected Chinese corpus data of approximately 696,000 tokenised words (including punctuation marks) which cover the topics of food, transportation, tourism, sports (including the Olympics) and business." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="86:299	In our experiment, we processed the texts from different topics together." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="87:299	These topics are related to each other under the themes of entertainment and business." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="88:299	Therefore we assume, by mixing the data together, we could examine the performance of the MWE tool in processing data from a broad range of related domains." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="89:299	We expect that the different features of texts from different domains will have a certain impact on the result, but the examination of such impact is beyond the scope of this paper." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="90:299	As mentioned earlier, the Chinese word tokeniser and POS tagger used in our experiment has been developed at CCID." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="91:299	It is an efficient tool running with accuracy of 98% for word tokenisation and 95% for POS annotation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="92:299	It employs a part-of-speech tagset of 15 categories shown in Table 2." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="93:299	Although it is not a finely grained tagset, it meets the need for creating POS pattern filters for MWE extraction." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="95:299	First, a word frequency list was extracted." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="96:299	Next, the top items were considered and we selected 70 closed class words for the stop word list." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="97:299	When the program searches for MWEs, such words are ignored." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="98:299	The threshold of word affinity strength is another issue to be addressed." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="99:299	In this experiment, we used log-likelihood to measure the strength of collocation between word pairs." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="100:299	Generally the log-likelihood score of 6.6 (p < 0.01 or 99% confidence) is recommended as the threshold (Rayson et al. , 2004), but it was found to produce too many false candidates in our case." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="101:299	Based on our initial trials, we used a higher threshold of 30, i.e. any word pairs producing log-likelihood score less than this value are ignored in the MWE searching process." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="102:299	Furthermore, for the sake of the reliability of the statistical score, when extracting collocates, a frequency threshold of five was used to filter out low-frequency words, i.e. word pairs with frequencies less than five were ignored." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="103:299	An interesting issue for us in this experiment is the impact of the length of collocation searching window on the MWE identification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="104:299	For this purpose, we tested two search window lengths 2 and 3, and compared the results obtained by using them." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="105:299	Our initial hypothesis was that the shorter window length may produce higher precision while the longer window length may sacrifice precision but boost the MWE coverage." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="106:299	The output of the tool was manually checked by Chinese experts at CCID, including cross checking to guarantee the reliability of the results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="107:299	There were some MWE candidates on which disagreements arose." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="108:299	In such cases, the 20 candidate was counted as false." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="109:299	Furthermore, in order to estimate the recall, experts manually identified MWEs in the whole test corpus, so that the output of the automatic tool could be compared against it." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="173:299	For example, in the Lancaster semantic lexicon (Rayson et al. , 2004), compositional word groups such as youth club are considered as MWEs alongside non-compositional expressions such as food for thought as they depict single semantic units or concepts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="174:299	Furthermore, for the MT research community whose primary concern is crosslanguage interpretation, any multiword units that have stable translation equivalent(s) in a target language can be of interest." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="4:230	1 Introduction Since Firth rst described collocations as habitual word combinations in the 1950ies (cf.Firth, 1968), a number of papers focusing on collocation extraction have been published (see the overviews in (Evert, 2004; Bartsch, 2004))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="6:230	Most studies concentrate on the extraction from English." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="7:230	However, the procedures proposed in these studies cannot necessarily be applied to other languages as English stands out, e.g. with respect to con gurationality." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="8:230	They rely on the fact that the syntax of English (and of all con gurational languages) provides positional clues to the grammatical function of noun phrases, and they exploit this concept by means of window-based, adjacency-based or pattern-based extraction, combined with association measures to identify co-occurrences that are more frequent than statistically expectable." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="10:230	a. A collocation is a combination of a free (autosematic) element (the base) and a lexically determined (synsemantic) element (the collocate, which may lose (some of) its meaning in a collocation) (adapted from (Hausmann, 1979; Hausmann, 1989; Hausmann, 2003))." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="11:230	b. A collocation is a word combination whose semantic and/or syntactic properties cannot be fully predicted from those of its components, and which therefore has to be listed in a lexicon (Evert, 2004)." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="12:230	We argue that linguistic knowledge could not only improve results (Krenn, 2000b; Smadja, 1993) but is essential when extracting collocations from certain languages: this knowledge provides other applications (or a lexicon user, respectively) with a ne-grained description of how the extracted collocations are to be used in context." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="13:230	Additional requirements resulting from the needs of dictionary users are described in (Hausmann, 2003; Heid and Gouws, 2005) and are of interest not only in lexicography but can also be transferred to the eld of natural language generation." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="31:230	One example is the order of adjective + noun pairs: in English and German, the adjective occurs left of the noun, whereas in French, the adjective can occur left or right of the noun." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="32:230	Another example is compounding, handled differently in different languages: noun + noun in English, typically separated by a white space (e.g. death penalty) vs. noun + prepositional phrase in French (e.g. peine de mort) vs. compound noun in German (e.g. Todesstrafe)." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="13:300	Automatic sentiment analysis enables a fast and comprehensive investigation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="14:300	The most fundamental step for sentiment analysis is to acquire the semantic orientations of words: positive or negative (desirable or undesirable)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="15:300	For example, the word beautiful is positive, while the word dirty is negative." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="16:300	Many researchers have developed several methods for this purpose and obtained good results." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:300	One of the next problems to be solved is to acquire semantic orientations of phrases, or multi-term expressions, such as high+risk and light+laptop-computer." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="23:300	The purpose of this paper is to propose a method for extracting semantic orientations of phrases, which is applicable also to expressions consisting of unseen words." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="24:300	In our method, we regard this task as the noun classification problem for each adjective; the nouns that become respectively positive (negative, or neutral) when combined with a given adjective are distinguished from the other nouns." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="37:237	2 Basic Concepts Although collocations are habitual expressions in natural language use and they can be easily understood by people, a precise definition of collocation is still far-reaching (Manning et al. 1999)." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:237	In this study, we define a collocation as a recurrent and conventional expression of two or more content words that holds syntactic and semantic relation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:237	Content words in Chinese include noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, directional word, and gerund." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:237	Collocations with only two words are called bi-gram collocations and others are called ngram collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="41:237	From a linguistic view point, collocations have a number of characteristics." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="42:237	Firstly, collocations are recurrent as they are of habitual use." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="43:237	Collocations occur frequently in similar contexts and they appear in certain fixed patterns." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="44:237	However, they cannot be described by the same set of syntactic or semantic rules." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="45:237	Secondly, free word combinations which can be generated by linguistic rules are normally considered compositional." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="46:237	In contrast, collocations should be limited compositional (Manning et al. 1999) and they usually carry additional meanings when used as a collocation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="47:237	Thirdly, collocations are also limited substitutable and limited modifiable." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="48:237	Limited substitutable here means that a word cannot be freely substituted by other words with similar linguistic functions in the same context such as synonyms." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="49:237	Also, many collocations cannot be modified freely by adding modifiers or through grammatical transformations." ></td>
	<td class="line oc" title="50:237	Lastly, collocations are domain-dependent (Smadja 1993) and language-dependent." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="51:237	3 Annotation Guideline Design The guideline firstly determines the annotation strategy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="52:237	(1) The annotation of CCB follows the headword-driven strategy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="53:237	The annotation uses selected headwords as the starting point." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="54:237	In each circle, the collocations corresponding to one headword are annotated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="55:237	Headword-driven strategy makes a more efficient annotation as it is helpful to estimate and compare the relevant collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="56:237	(2) CCB is manually annotated with the help of automatic estimation of computational features, i.e. semi-automatic software tools are used to generate parsing and chunking candidates and to estimate the classification features." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="57:237	These data are present to the annotators for determination." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="58:237	The use of assistive tools is helpful to produce accurate annotations with efficiency." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="59:237	The guideline also specifies the information to be annotated and the labels used in the annotation." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="60:237	For a given headword, CCB annotates both bigram collocations and n-gram collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="61:237	Considering the fact that n-gram collocations consisting of continuous significant bi-grams as a whole and, the n-gram annotation is based on the identification and verification of bi-gram word combinations and is prior to the annotation of bi-gram collocations." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="62:237	For bi-gram annotation, which is the major interest in collocation research, three kinds of information are annotated." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="63:237	The first one is the syntactic dependency of the headword and its co-word in a bi-gram collocation . A syntactic dependency normally consists of one word as the governor (or head), a dependency type and another word serves 62 as dependent (or modifier) (Lin 1998).Totally, 10 types of dependencies are annotated in CCB." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="64:237	They are listed in Table 1 below." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="65:237	Dependency Description Example ADA Adjective and its adverbial modifier  /d  /a greatly painful ADV Predicate and its adverbial modifier in which the predicate serves as head  /ad  /v heavily strike AN Noun and its adjective modifier  /a  /n lawful incoming CMP Predicate and its complement in which the predicate serves as head  /v  /v ineffectively treat NJX Juxtaposition structure  /a  /a fair and reasonable NN Noun and its nominal modifier  /n  /n personal safety SBV Predicate and its subject  /n  /v property transfer VO Predicate and its object in which the predicate serves as head  /v  /n change mechanism VV Serial verb constructions which indicates that there are serial actions  /v  /v trace and report OT Others Table 1." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="16:209	Relevant documents are defined here as pairs of English and Japanese documents that report identical or closely related contents, e.g., a pair of documents describing an aircraft crash and the ensuing investigation to compensate the victims families or any safety measures proposed as a result of the crash." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="17:209	In the task of retrieving cross-lingual relevant documents, it is crucial to identify an event as something occurs at some specific place and time associated with some specific action." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="18:209	One solution is to use a topic, i.e., category in the hierarchical structure, such as Internet directories." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="19:209	Although a topic is not an event, it can be a broader class of event." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="20:209	Therefore, it is helpful for retrieving relevant documents, and thus bilingual verbnoun collocations." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="33:209	In the Reuters96 hierarchy, the system was trained using labeled English documents, and classified translated labeled Japanese 1 The reason for retrieving pairs of categories is that each categorical hierarchy is defined by individual human experts, and different linguists often identify different numbers of categories for the same concepts." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="34:209	Therefore, it is impossible to handle full integration of hierarchies." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="35:209	Figure 2: Cross-language text classification documents." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="37:209	We used Japanese-English and English-Japanese MT software." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="38:209	We used a learning model, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995), to classify documents, as SVMs have been shown to be effective for text classification." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="39:209	We used the One-againstthe-Rest version of the SVMs at each level of a hierarchy." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="40:209	We classify test documents using a hierarchy by learning separate classifiers at each internal node of the hierarchy." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="10:157	Unithood is only relevant to complex terms (i.e. multi-word terms) while termhood (Wong et al., 2007a) deals with both simple terms (i.e. singleword terms) and complex terms." ></td>

	<td class="line x" title="72:157	Next, we perform random draws (i.e. trial) of documents from N. For each lexical unit w  W, there will be a corresponding set of outcomes (i.e. events) from the draw." ></td>
	<td class="line x" title="73:157	There will be three basic sets which are of interest to us: Definition 2 Basic events corresponding to each w  W:  X is the event that ax occurs in the document  Y is the event that ay occurs in the document  S is the event that s occurs in the document It should be obvious to the readers that since the documents in S have to contain all two units ax and ay, S is a subset of X  Y or S  X  Y . It is worth noting that even though S  X  Y , it is highly unlikely that S = X  Y since the two portions ax and ay may exist in the same document without being conjoined by b. Next, subscribing to the frequency interpretation of probability, we can obtain the probability of the events in Definition 2 in terms of Google page count: P(X) = nx|N| (4) P(Y) = ny|N| P(S) = ns|N| where nx, ny and ns is the page count returned as the result of Google search using the term [+ax], [+ay] and [+s], respectively." ></td>

P(U|E) is the posterior probability that s is a stable unit given the evidence E. P(U) is the prior probability that s is a unit without any evidence, and P(E) is the prior probability of evidences held by s.
